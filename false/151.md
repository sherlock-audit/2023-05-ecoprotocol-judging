# Burning token by user on the L2 has no effect on the L1's totalSupply

## Summary
Any user can burn owned tokens on the L2. But it doesn't affect the `totalSupply` in L1. Tokens only will be locked in the `L1ECOBridge` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `burn` function in the `L2ECO.sol` lets users burn their own tokens. It changes `_totalSupply` of ECO token on L2 but doesn't change `L1ECOBridge` contract's balance of L1 ECO tokens. 

## Impact
Tokens will be locked on the `L1ECOBridge`. It is not expected behavior for the standart bridge. https://ethereum.org/ph/developers/tutorials/optimism-std-bridge-annotated-code/#erc-20-tokens-on-l2

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I suggest making the `burn` function restricted for users or making a function in `L2ECOBridge` to equalize tokens amounts in L1ECOBridge balance with `_totalSupply` of ECO token on L2.
