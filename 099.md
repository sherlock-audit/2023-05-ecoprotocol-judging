# use "safeIncreaseAllowance" and "safeDecreaseAllowance" instead of "increaseAllowance" and "decreaseAllowance"

## Summary
## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens like USDT require resetting the approval to 0 first before being able to reset it to another value.
The ohm.approve, pairToken.approve, pool.approve function does not do this - unlike OpenZeppelin's safeApprove implementation.

## Impact
Some ERC20 tokens do not revert if an approval fails, and because the return value is not checked, the contract would not be aware of this failure, potentially causing malfunctions in later operations

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to set the allowance to zero before increasing the allowance and use safeApprove/safeIncreaseAllowance.
