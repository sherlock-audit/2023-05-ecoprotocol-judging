# L2ECO should have pausable functionality

## Summary
`ECO.sol` on L1 has pausable functionality which allows any interactions to be frozen in case of an emergency (e.g. an exploit); however, `L2ECO.sol` does not have any such functionality. This means that users will be able to freely initiate transactions on the layer 2 even though the L1 token is frozen
## Vulnerability Detail
I have assigned medium severity as it does not cause monetary losses however users will be able to avoid the pause functionality by depositing onto the `L2Bridge`
## Impact
See above

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add pausable modifiers to any transfer/mint/burn functions in `L2ECO.sol`
