# It is still possible to send invalid `inflationMultiplier` to L2 while L1 is on paused

## Summary

When L1 token is on paused, L1 token can not do any transactions. So any new `inflationMultiplier` during the pause is invalid because it cannot be used. But these `inflationMultipliers` can still be sent to L2 and used in transactions.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol
296     function rebase(uint32 _l2Gas) external {
297         inflationMultiplier = IECO(l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(
298             block.number
299         );
300
301         bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
302             IL2ECOBridge.rebase.selector,
303             inflationMultiplier
304         );
305
306         sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, _l2Gas, message);
307     }
```

When L1 is on pause, it can still update `inflationMultiplier`. And the `rebase` function can called when L1 is on pause. So all new `inflationMultipliers` can be sent to L2 during the pause, which causes the `inflationMultiplier` deviation between L2 and L1 (For L1, `inflationMultipliers` is fixed at the value before the pause, because it can not transfer after the pause).

## Impact

There may be `inflationMultipliers` on L2 that are not used on L1, and attackers use this for arbitrage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended that `rebase` can not be called when L1 is on pause
