# Potential Front-running Vulnerability Due to Unrestricted Rebase Function in L1ECOBridge Affecting Withdrawals

## Summary
This report discusses a potential vulnerability in the L1ECOBridge smart contract caused by the unrestricted rebase function. The issue arises from the possibility that an actor could call the rebase function, which adjusts the inflationMultiplier, just after a user initiates a withdrawal but before it's finalized. This might result in a user receiving less tokens than expected due to an updated inflationMultiplier, which can be particularly impactful in large transfer scenarios. The vulnerability is particularly concerning given the inherent asynchronicity and latency in cross-chain interactions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The rebase function in the L1ECOBridge contract can be called by any actor without restriction. The function adjusts the inflationMultiplier in the L1ECOBridge contract where the next update is having the value of inflationMultiplier increased, and the change is propagated to the L2ECOBridge contract. However, if a user initiates a withdrawal from L2ECOBridge and during the period of processing (which due to cross-chain interactions could be considerable), someone deliberately calls the rebase function, the updated/inflated inflationMultiplier would be applied to the withdrawal amount when it is finalized in L1ECOBridge. This could result in the withdrawal being smaller than what the user had initiated.

## Impact
If a bad actor calls the rebase function immediately after a withdrawal is initiated, but before it is finalized, they could effectively reduce the amount of tokens the user receives. The severity of this issue is exacerbated in cases of large transfers and even if the change in the inflationMultiplier is small. Such manipulation can lead to significant losses for users, negatively affect the platform's credibility, and potentially undermine the token's usability.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, one could consider implementing access controls on the rebase function. This might include only allowing trusted accounts or contracts to call rebase. Moreover, measures could be implemented to account for the asynchronicity of the cross-chain interaction, such as locking the inflationMultiplier during the processing of a withdrawal, or delaying the application of a new inflationMultiplier to allow for all pending transactions to complete. It is essential to consider the trade-offs between security, user experience, and the effectiveness of the rebase function.
