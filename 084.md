# Attempt to send cross domain message will always revert in `finalizeERC20Withdrawal` function call due to improper `_gasLimit`

## Summary

The `sendCrossDomainMessage` function call in the `finalizeERC20Withdrawal` function in the L1ECOBridge contract will always revert, preventing communication with the L2 bridge

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `finalizeERC20Withdrawal` function in the L1ECOBridge contract, the `_gasLimit` in the `sendCrossDomainMessage` function call is set to 0. This is an issue because the `_gasLimit` needs to be at least equal to `MIN_ROLLUP_TX_GAS`, which is specified in the CanonicalTransactionChain contract.

The flow of transactions up to the revert is as follows (after `sendMessage` is called):

2. https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts/contracts/L1/messaging/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#L371
3. https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts/contracts/L1/rollup/CanonicalTransactionChain.sol#LL227C42-L227C42

## Impact

The `sendCrossDomainMessage` function call in the `finalizeERC20Withdrawal` function will always revert, blocking communication with the L2 bridge when a transfer from L2 to L1 fails

## Recommendation

Provide a reasonable value for `_gatLimit` rather than 0
