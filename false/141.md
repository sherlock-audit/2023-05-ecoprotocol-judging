# Deposits, withdrawals and rebase won't work when the L2 bridge is upgraded because it wont have permission on the L2ECO token

## Summary
L2ECO has different functions managed by `onlyTokenRoleAdmin`, which is set to the `_l2Bridge` address given in the `initializer`.  However the bridge does not have any ability to execute these functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's look at the different functions. 
- `updateMinters`
- `updateBurners`
- `updateRebasers`
- `updateTokenRoleAdmin`

These functions can be used to give the appropriate role and remove permissions for example when the L2 bridge is upgraded. However within the current implementation of the bridge there's no way to update the permissions so the new bridge can `mint` or `burn`. If the bridge tries to `mint` or `burn` tokens it won't work because it doesn't have the needed role. I don't think this is a high, since `L2ECO` can be upgraded from the bridge, assuming the new implementation still enables this, but the bridge would also need to be upgraded again pointing to the new `L2ECO` token.
## Impact
When the L2 bridge is upgraded, it won't be able to handle deposits or withdrawals. Users will be stuck on L2 or unable to bridge until a new L2ECO is deployed and a new bridge, since `l2Eco` is set in the initialization of the bridge. 
## Code Snippet
Let's look at minting for this example. 
[Link to code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/token/L2ECO.sol#LL96C7-L96C7)
```solidity
modifier onlyMinterRole() {
        require(minters[msg.sender], "L2ECO: not authorized to mint");
        _;
    }
```
It is set during initialization:
[Link to code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/token/L2ECO.sol#L155)
```solidity
  minters[_l2Bridge] = true;
```
Only the token role admin can update the minters, which is also the `_l2Bridge`
```solidity
function updateMinters(address _key, bool _value)
        public
        onlyTokenRoleAdmin
    {
        minters[_key] = _value;
    }
```
Lastly the `finalizeDeposit` from the `L2ECOBridge.sol` contract. So when a new bridge calls the `mint` function it won't have permission and the new bridge won't be able to update permissions. 
```solidity
 function finalizeDeposit(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes calldata _data
    )
        external
        virtual
        onlyFromCrossDomainAccount(l1TokenBridge)
        isL1EcoToken(_l1Token)
        isL2EcoToken(_l2Token)
    {
        // When a deposit is finalized, we convert the transferred gons to ECO using the current
        // inflation multiplier, then we credit the account on L2 with the same amount of tokens.
        _amount = _amount / inflationMultiplier;
        L2ECO(_l2Token).mint(_to, _amount);
        emit DepositFinalized(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Call `updateTokenRoleAdmin` within `upgradeSelf` before upgrading.
```diff
 function upgradeSelf(
        address _newBridgeImpl
    ) external virtual onlyFromCrossDomainAccount(l1TokenBridge) {
        //cast to a payable address since l2Eco is the proxy address of a ITransparentUpgradeableProxy contract
        address payable proxyAddr = payable(address(this));

        ITransparentUpgradeableProxy proxy = ITransparentUpgradeableProxy(proxyAddr);
        l2ProxyAdmin.upgrade(proxy, _newBridgeImpl);

        emit UpgradeSelf(_newBridgeImpl);
    }

function upgradeSelf(
    address _newBridgeImpl
) external virtual onlyFromCrossDomainAccount(l1TokenBridge) {
    //cast to a payable address since l2Eco is the proxy address of a ITransparentUpgradeableProxy contract
    address payable proxyAddr = payable(address(this));
+  l2Eco.updateTokenRoleAdmin(_newBridgeImpl);
    ITransparentUpgradeableProxy proxy = ITransparentUpgradeableProxy(proxyAddr);
    l2ProxyAdmin.upgrade(proxy, _newBridgeImpl);

    emit UpgradeSelf(_newBridgeImpl);
}

```
