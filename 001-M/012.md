# Sufficient gas limit required to avoid message failure and irreversible consequences

## Summary
When sending a message from L1 to L2,if the specified gas limit is insufficient for the execution of the message on L2, the message will fail, and any changes or actions associated with that message will not take effect. This can result in unexpected outcomes and the inability to rectify the situation once the message has been processed.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `L1ECOBridge.finalizeERC20Withdrawal()` function is used to finalize the withdrawal of ERC20 tokens from L2 to L1 of the Ethereum network. Inside the function,it  makes a low-level call to the L1 token contract (_l1Token) with the constructed message. 
```solidity
  (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = _l1Token.call{value: 0}(
            _ecoTransferMessage
        );

        // make sure that the call to transfer didn't revert or return false
        if (success && abi.decode(returnData, (bool))) {
            // if successful, emit an event
            emit ERC20WithdrawalFinalized(
                _l1Token,
                _l2Token,
                _from,
                _to,
                _amount,
                _data
            );
        } else {
            // if the transfer fails, create a return tx
            bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
                IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector,
                _l1Token,
                _l2Token,
                _to, // switched the _to and _from here to bounce back the deposit to the sender
                _from,
                _gonsAmount,
                _data
            );

            // Send message up to L1 bridge
            sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, 0, message);

```
 It checks if the call was successful (success is true) and the return value of the call is true.If the transfer fails, the function proceeds to create a return transaction by encoding a message with the selector IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector and relevant parameters. The _to and _from addresses are switched here to bounce back the deposit to the original sender.The encoded message is then sent up to the L1 bridge using the sendCrossDomainMessage function, specifying a gas limit of 0. 
```solidity
 sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, 0, message);

```
Here is the problem,when sending a message from L1 to L2, it is important to specify the gas limit for the execution on L2. However, the most crucial aspect to note is that the gas limit must be sufficient. The contract has a safeguard check in place, which verifies a minimum value called MIN_ROLLUP_TX_GAS (currently set to 100,000 gas).

```solidity
require(
            _gasLimit <= maxTransactionGasLimit,
            "Transaction gas limit exceeds maximum for rollup transaction."
        );

        require(_gasLimit >= MIN_ROLLUP_TX_GAS, "Transaction gas limit too low to enqueue.");

```
If the gas used by message is not sufficient , the transaction will fail, and there will be no way to remedy the situation.

## Impact
Transactions may fail, causing user funds to be locked in the contract.
