# If rebase happens during L1 to L2 token transfer, then L2 tokens may not get the equivalent L1 deposit

## Summary

Rebasing after L1 deposit and before L2 minting may result in different token amounts minted.

## Vulnerability Detail

Function rebase in L2ECO is only called by trusted rebaser roles, and its duty is to change the Inflation Multiplier.

```solidity
    rebase(uint256 _newLinearInflationMultiplier)
        external
        onlyRebaserRole
    {
        _rebase(_newLinearInflationMultiplier);
        emit NewInflationMultiplier(_newLinearInflationMultiplier);
    }
```

When tokens are deposited in L1 through _initiateERC20Deposit, the tokens are multiplied by an inflationMultiplier

```solidity
        _amount = _amount * inflationMultiplier;
```

After tokens are deposited, the data is sent to the L2 bridge for confirmation.

```solidity
        bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            //call parent interface IL2ERC20Bridge to get the selector
            IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector,
            _l1Token,
            _l2Token,
            _from,
            _to,
            _amount,
            _data
        );

        // Send calldata into L2
        sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, _l2Gas, message);
```

When the L2 bridge finalizes the deposit, it will divide the _amount by the inflationMultiplier and mint the appropriate _amount to the user. 

```solidity
    function finalizeDeposit(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes calldata _data
    )
        external
        virtual
        onlyFromCrossDomainAccount(l1TokenBridge)
        isL1EcoToken(_l1Token)
        isL2EcoToken(_l2Token)
    {
        // When a deposit is finalized, we convert the transferred gons to ECO using the current
        // inflation multiplier, then we credit the account on L2 with the same amount of tokens.
        _amount = _amount / inflationMultiplier;
        L2ECO(_l2Token).mint(_to, _amount);
```

If the inflation multiplier happens to change after depositing in L1 but before finalizing in L2, then the user will not get the correct amount of tokens. 

## Impact

User may not get the corresponding number of tokens from the source bridge if inflation multiplier is changed halfway

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check that the infflation multiplier is not changed halfway during finalizeDeposit.
