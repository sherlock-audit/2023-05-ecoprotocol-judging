# payable(address(this)) conversion is not possible if contract is not payable

## Summary
It is not possible to upgrade contracts because it is not possible to cast payable() to contract that does not have ability to receive ether.
## Vulnerability Detail
In [L1EcoBridge](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L174-L184):
```solidity
function upgradeSelf(address _newBridgeImpl) external virtual onlyUpgrader {
        //cast to a payable address since l2EcoToken is the proxy address of a ITransparentUpgradeableProxy contract
        address payable proxyAddr = payable(address(this));

        ITransparentUpgradeableProxy proxy = ITransparentUpgradeableProxy(
            proxyAddr
        );
        l1ProxyAdmin.upgrade(proxy, _newBridgeImpl);

        emit UpgradeSelf(_newBridgeImpl);
    }
```
and in [L2EcoBridge.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L2ECOBridge.sol#L184-L218)
```solidity
function upgradeECO(address _newEcoImpl)
        external
        virtual
        onlyFromCrossDomainAccount(l1TokenBridge)
    {
        //cast to a payable address since l2Eco is the proxy address of a ITransparentUpgradeableProxy contract
        address payable proxyAddr = payable(address(l2Eco));

        ITransparentUpgradeableProxy proxy = ITransparentUpgradeableProxy(
            proxyAddr
        );
        l2ProxyAdmin.upgrade(proxy, _newEcoImpl);

        emit UpgradeECOImplementation(_newEcoImpl);
    }
...
function upgradeSelf(address _newBridgeImpl)
        external
        virtual
        onlyFromCrossDomainAccount(l1TokenBridge)
    {
        //cast to a payable address since l2Eco is the proxy address of a ITransparentUpgradeableProxy contract
        address payable proxyAddr = payable(address(this));

        ITransparentUpgradeableProxy proxy = ITransparentUpgradeableProxy(
            proxyAddr
        );
        l2ProxyAdmin.upgrade(proxy, _newBridgeImpl);

        emit UpgradeSelf(_newBridgeImpl);
    }
```
these functions try to cast address(this) to payable(address(this)) in order to upgrade contracts.
In order to do this casting operation the underlying contract needs to be payable. Explanation from [Solidity Documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html#address):
> Only expressions of type address and contract-type can be converted to the type address payable via the explicit conversion payable(...). For contract-type, this conversion is only allowed if the contract can [receive](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#receive-ether-function) Ether, i.e., the contract either has a receive or a payable fallback function. Note that payable(0) is valid and is an exception to this rule.

Since these contracts don't have ```receive()``` or a payable ```fallback()``` function, ```upgradeEco``` and ```upgradeSelf``` functions will revert.

## Impact
Upgrade functions will revert and it won't be possible to upgrade contracts because of aforementioned forbidden cast.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Create a receive or fallback function in order for contracts to be payable. If you don't want contracts to be payable change the implementations of upgrade functions.
