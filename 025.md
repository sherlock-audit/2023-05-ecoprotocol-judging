# The L1ECOBridge can be attacked to drain funds

## Summary

The ECO token uses a `inflationMultiplier` variable which changes the user's virtual balances (rebase token). The `L1ECOBridge` and `L2ECOBridge` needs to know this variable. This is accomplished in the `rebase()` function at the `L1ECOBridge` contract which queries the current `inflationMultiplier` of the ECO token, update its own `inflationMultiplier` variable and sends a message to the `L2ECOBridge` to do the same.

The deposits functions at the `L1ECOBridge` don't verify that the `inflationMultiplier` has already been synced across the three contracts, or just between the ECO token and the L1 Bridge (because updating this, updates also the L2 Bridge). Which allows to draining the funds on the `L1ECOBridge` contract when:

`ECO.inflationMultiplier < L1ECOBridge.inflationMultiplier` 

(the other side is also possible when `ECO.inflationMultiplier > L1ECOBridge.inflationMultiplier`).

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's imagine this scenario to understand the implications of the vulnerability.

`ECO.inflationMultiplier = 50%`. This is equivalent to 5e17.

`L1ECOBridge.inflationMultiplier = 100%`. This is equivalent to 1e18.

`L2ECOBridge.inflationMultiplier = 100%`. This is equivalent to 1e18.

As we can see the `inflationMultiplier` has not been synced through the `rebase()` function at the `L1ECOBriddge` contract. 

Lets say the attacker has 100 (real) ECO tokens. Because the `inflationMultiplier` in the ECO token is 50%, then [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/b440f89234b806f672b9e9ad24cf70c409964db5/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L333) line of code on the `_initiateERC20Deposit()` function will allow the attacker to set `_amount` to 200 (virtual) tokens.

`IECO(_l1Token).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);`


Because the `inflationMultiplier` on the bridges is 100%, the `L2ECOBridge.sol` contract will credit to the attacker 200 (real) tokens.

After this, the attacker can call `rebase()` on the `L1ECOBridge` contract to set the `inflationMultiplier` to 50% and withdraw 400 (virtual) tokens from the `L2ECOBridge` contract. At some point `finalizeERC20Withdrawal` on the L1 Bridge will be called and the L1 Bridge will transfer 400 (virtual) tokens to the Attacker which will end-up being 200 (real) tokens.

The Attacker started with 100 real ECO tokens and ended up with 200 real ECO tokens at the expense of other users ECO tokens in the `L1ECOBridge` contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Only allow deposits and withdrawals if the `inflationMultiplier` variable is synced between the ECO token contract and the `L1ECOBridge` contract.
