# Out of sync layer1 and layer2 inflation multiplier can be gamed

## Summary

The inflation multiplier for layer1 and layer2 will vary during the transaction's transfer from layer1 to layer2. Within this timeframe, any user can exploit the rebase mechanism to acquire extra tokens on layer2

The ECO protocol's governance has the ability onChain vote for altering the inflation multiplier. 

A Reveal Phase of one day exists, providing the attacker with extra time to compute the outcome and manipulate the rebase process. Since the user has control over potential layer 1 reverts and finalizeERC20Withdrawal() sends tokens back in such cases, they can intentionally trigger a revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Look for inflation multiplier change to smaller then the current one

2. Init withdraw on layer2 to address(0) of 100 tokens, inflation multiplier is 10 on L2

3. inflation multiplier is voted to change to 9 on L1

4. In L2, init withdraw for 100 tokens, Because of _amount = _amount * Inflation Multiplier; in line 240
total send amount will be 1000 (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L2ECOBridge.sol#L240)

5. When finalize the withdrawal in L1, transfer to address(0) on layer1 will revert (ECO token transfers to 0 will revert)

finalizeERC20Withdrawal() will send transferred amount back to layer2, the total amount send will be 1000 (_gonsAmount)

```solidity
// if the transfer fails, create a return tx
bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
	IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector,
	_l1Token,
	_l2Token,
	_to, // switched the _to and _from here to bounce back the deposit to the sender
	_from,
	_gonsAmount,
	_data
);
```

on layer2 the tokens are calculated with the new inflation multiplier, which is 9

this means that 1000 / 9 = 111
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L2ECOBridge.sol#L161)

User gained 11 wei tokens (or gons), the larger the user on L2, the more gain the user acquires

## Impact
User will gain amount of tokens proportional to inflation multiplier change on layer 2.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider sending the inflation multiplier with the layer2 to layer1 transaction.

After the layer1 transaction reverts, calculate the minted amount in finalizeDeposit() on layer2 with the old inflation multiplier.
