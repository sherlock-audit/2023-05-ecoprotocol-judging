# _transfer in ERC20Upgradeable doesn’t check from != to

## Summary
_transfer in ERC20Upgradeable doesn’t check from != to

## Vulnerability Detail
if from = to, self-transfer occurs
 _balances[from] = fromBalance - gonsAmount;
 _balances[to] += gonsAmount;

## Impact
If the "from" and "to" address are the same then the balance of "from" is overwritten by the balance of "to".
This means the balance of "from" and "to" are increased and no balances are decreased, effectively printing money.

## Recommendation
add require(from != to, "same address")
