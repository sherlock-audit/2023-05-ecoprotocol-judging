# L1ECOBridge not check inflationMultiplier is valid

## Summary

L2ECOBridge checked the valid of `inflationMultiplier`, but L1ECOBridge not.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the inflationMultiplier is updated and invalid, since the tx is not atomized, L1ECOBridge updates normally and L2ECOBridge updates tx revert.     
At this point, the behavior of the two bridges forks, assuming that the inflationMultiplier is updated to 0(which might be 0 according to code validation):    
- On the L1ECOBridge, depositToL2 and withdrawFromL2 will revert
- On the L2ECOBridge, depositFromL1 and withdrawToL1 perform normally

In this case, when the user withdraws in L2, the L1 operation will revert, and the following deposit logic will not be executed, thus the user's funds will be lost.     

## Impact

Medium. L1ECOBridge DOS, user funds lost.
