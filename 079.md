# L2ECO is not pausable but L1 ECO is pausable

## Summary

The L2ECO token is not pausable, but the L1 ECO is pausable. In case of a catastrophic event, when the L1 token needs to be paused, L2 token transfers will still be allowed to happen.

## Vulnerability Detail

The L1 ECO token inherits from `ERC20Pausable` from OpenZeppelin, and thus when it is paused, all transfers revert. However, the L2ECO token does not have the same functionality. It will always be possible to be exchanged and traded on the open market, even if the L1 ECO is paused. 

This creates a risk for the ecosystem, since all Governance decisions are happening on L1. In case of a security incident where the L1 token needs to be paused, the L2 token will still flow into the open market, possibly disrupting the Eco project.

## Impact

L2ECO token can still be traded even if L1 ECO is paused.
