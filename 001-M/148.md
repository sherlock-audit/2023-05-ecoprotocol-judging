# Gasless Bridging from L1 to L2

## Summary
There is no check for minimum gas limit in functions ```depositERC20``` and ```depositERC20to``` hence it is possible to bridge L1 to L2 without using any gas.
## Vulnerability Detail
In [depositERC20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L187-206) and [depositERC20To](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L208-229) functions:
```solidity
/**
     * @inheritdoc IL1ERC20Bridge
     * @param _l1Token must be the ECO L1 token address.
     */
    function depositERC20(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _l2Gas,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external virtual onlyEOA isL1EcoToken(_l1Token) isL2EcoToken(_l2Token) {
        _initiateERC20Deposit(
            _l1Token,
            _l2Token,
            msg.sender,
            msg.sender,
            _amount,
            _l2Gas,
            _data
        );
    }

    /**
     * @inheritdoc IL1ERC20Bridge
     * @param _l1Token must be the ECO L1 token address.
     */
    function depositERC20To(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _l2Gas,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external virtual isL1EcoToken(_l1Token) isL2EcoToken(_l2Token) {
        _initiateERC20Deposit(
            _l1Token,
            _l2Token,
            msg.sender,
            _to,
            _amount,
            _l2Gas,
            _data
        );
    }
```
the parameter ```_l2Gas``` has no boundaries. Which makes it possible to deposit tokens with 0 gas. We also know that it is possible to send transaction with 0 gas because in [finalizeERC20Withdrawal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L280)'s else block we have transaction with 0 gas amount hard-coded.
```solidity
 sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, 0, message);
```
While in the function ```finalizeERC20Withdraw``` it is intended use, because it is for edge cases where transaction revert and hence user has nothing to do with it (for example ECO token in L1 might be in paused state ), in the deposit functions it is not intended because it makes it possible to bridge L1 to L2 in a gasless fashion, without paying in advance for the L2 resources consumed.
## Impact
Users might deposit tokens from L1, without paying any gas fee in L2.

Set minimum amount for ```_l2Gas``` parameter.
