# The onlyEOA modifier does not work as expected.

## Summary

The given L1ECOBridge contract  includes a modifier onlyEOA(), which is designed to restrict certain operations to externally owned accounts (EOAs). However, a vulnerability exists that may allow a malicious contract to bypass this restriction.

## Vulnerability Detail

The onlyEOA() modifier in the contract uses msg.sender.code.length == 0 to check whether the msg.sender is an EOA. This check would return true for an EOA, but  this check will pass if we call it from contract constructor, during a contract's constructor call, its code is not yet stored at its address, so the check will pass.

## Impact

The depositERC20 function, which requires onlyEOA, might be called by a contract, not by an EOA, onlyEOA modifier does not work as expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The recommended way to prevent this is to change the onlyEOA modifier to use require(msg.sender == tx.origin). This ensures that only externally owned accounts (EOAs), and not contracts, can interact with the functions that apply this modifier, because tx.origin always refers to the original sender of the transaction, which must be an EOA.

```diff
    modifier onlyEOA() {
        // Used to stop deposits from contracts (avoid accidentally lost tokens)
-        require(msg.sender.code.length == 0, "L1ECOBridge: Account not EOA");
+       require(msg.sender == tx.origin, "L1ECOBridge: Account not EOA");
        _;
    }
```
