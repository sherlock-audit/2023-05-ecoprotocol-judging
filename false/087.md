# `onlyEOA` modifier can be bypassed and lead to loss of user funds

## Summary

`onlyEOA` modifier can be bypassed

## Vulnerability Detail

This is a vulnerability which occurs when smart contracts depend on code length of the interacting address to verify whether they are contracts or EOA.
Similarly here, there is a modifier which checks `msg.sender.code.length == 0` in order to ensure that the interacting address is an EOA. However, this check can easily be bypassed if an interacting smart contract has the code written inside its **constructor**.

For any contract where the code is written inside the constructor `msg.sender.code.length == 0` . Thus the purpose of `onlyEOA` failed and now even the contracts can  interact with the smart contracts, bypassing these checks.

## Impact

Contracts can bypass the checks performed by `onlyEOA()` modifier and since the contracts can interact with the smart contract now it is possible that funds are sent to L2 where the contract address doesn't even exist.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L61-L65

```solidity
    modifier onlyEOA() {
        // Used to stop deposits from contracts (avoid accidentally lost tokens)
        require(msg.sender.code.length == 0, "L1ECOBridge: Account not EOA"); //@audit EOA check can be bypassed if the attacker contract has content in constructor
        _;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Generally for this bug class, whitelisting the addresses is recommended so that only the whitelisted EOAs can interact.
However, here since it is meant to be used by everyone - whitelisting before hand won't be an option. Instead the smart contract should allow users to whitelist themselves first.
It can be done via a mapping and a function.
For instance something like the following can be done:

```solidity
mapping (address => bool) public isWhitelisted;

function public whitelist() {
//the receiver of the funds will whitelist themselves here.
isWhitelisted[msg.sender] = true;
}

    modifier onlyEOA(address _to) {
        // Used to stop deposits from contracts (avoid accidentally lost tokens)
        require(isWhitelisted[_to], "L1ECOBridge: Account not EOA"); 
        _;
    }

```
Now, basically, user is whitelisting themselves first and acknowledging that in case any fund loss happens it is on the user and not the protocol.

This is just one approach which can be used, other approaches can be thought of as well.
