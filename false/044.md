# Underpaying `l2Gas`/`l1Gas` in `L1ECOBridge` and/or `L2ECOBridge` May Lead to Loss of User Funds


## Summary

The contract `L1ECOBridge` is susceptible to a vulnerability where underpaying the `l2Gas` value provided by users can result in a potential loss of funds. This vulnerability exists in the `depositERC20()` and `depositERC20To()` functions, which allow users to initiate deposits by specifying the `l2Gas` value. If the provided `l2Gas` value is insufficient/underpaid, it may cause the `finalizeDeposit` function in the L2 bridge contract to fail, resulting in a loss of the deposited funds.

### NB I believe this issue affects both `L1ECOBridge` and `L2ECOBridge`, but this report focus on only the instance in `L1ECOBridge`. Thw same idea should be applied to `L2ECOBridge` but in that case the affected vars/functions would be `l1Gas/withdraw() andwithdrawTo()`

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability is present in the `_initiateERC20Deposit()` function of the `L1ECOBridge` contract, which is like the helper function after users call [depositERC20() and depositERC20To()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/b440f89234b806f672b9e9ad24cf70c409964db5/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L186-L229)

```solidity
//ommited a few things for brevity
    function depositERC20(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _l2Gas,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external virtual onlyEOA isL1EcoToken(_l1Token) isL2EcoToken(_l2Token) {
        _initiateERC20Deposit(,,, _l2Gas,);
    }

    function depositERC20To(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _l2Gas,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external virtual isL1EcoToken(_l1Token) isL2EcoToken(_l2Token) {
  _initiateERC20Deposit(,,, _l2Gas,);
  }

```

Now take a look at [\_initiateERC20Deposit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/b440f89234b806f672b9e9ad24cf70c409964db5/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L309-L360)

```solidity
    function _initiateERC20Deposit(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _l2Gas,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) internal {
        // When a deposit is initiated on L1, the L1 Bridge transfers the funds to itself for future
        // withdrawals.

        IECO(_l1Token).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);
        // gons move across the bridge, with inflation multipliers on either side to correctly scale balances
        _amount = _amount * inflationMultiplier;

        // Construct calldata for _l2Token.finalizeDeposit(_to, _amount)
        bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            //call parent interface IL2ERC20Bridge to get the selector
            IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector,
            _l1Token,
            _l2Token,
            _from,
            _to,
            _amount,
            _data
        );

        // Send calldata into L2
        sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, _l2Gas, message);

        emit ERC20DepositInitiated(
            _l1Token,
            _l2Token,
            _from,
            _to,
            _amount,
            _data
        );
    }
```

As seen after transferring the specified amount of L1 ECO tokens from the user's account to the contract's address, the contract constructs a calldata message for the `finalizeDeposit` function and sends this calldata into the L2 bridge contract. The user-provided `l2Gas` value is included in this message. Problem is if the `l2Gas` provided by the user is underpaid, `finalizeDeposit` would fail and user funds will be lost

## Impact

If users provide an insufficient `l2Gas` value when initiating a deposit, it can result in the failure of the `finalizeDeposit` function in the L2 bridge contract. Consequently, the deposited funds may be lost, leading to potential financial losses for the affected users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate the risk of losing user funds, it is crucial to address the issue and provide clear guidance to users. The following recommendations are suggested:

1. **Enhance Documentation:** Update the user documentation, developer guides, and communication channels to emphasize the importance of providing an adequate `l2Gas/l1Gas` value when initiating deposits. Clearly explain the potential consequences of underpaying the `l2Gas/l1Gas` value and provide specific guidance on determining an appropriate value.

2. **Input Validation:** Implement input validation mechanisms to ensure that users provide a sufficient `l2Gas/l1Gas` value when initiating deposits. This can include setting minimum gas limits and providing warnings when users provide values that are below the recommended thresholds.
