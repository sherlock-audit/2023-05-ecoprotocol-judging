# Functions finalizeERC20Withdrawal() and _initiateERC20Deposit() does not rebase inflationMultiplier

## Summary

Functions `finalizeERC20Withdrawal()` and `_initiateERC20Deposit()` does not rebase `inflationMultiplier` when processing withdrawal or deposit respectively. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `rebase()` is used to compute and set the current `inflationMultiplier` from the `l1Eco` contract. The function `finalizeERC20Withdrawal()` and `_initiateERC20Deposit()` uses the `inflationMultiplier` to compute the amount of tokens to be transferred. The functions does not fetch the current `inflationMultiplier` and utilizes previous value based on the existing `rebase()` call.

## Impact

The would lead to loss or gain of token value based on `inflationMultiplier` as it is not updated during the function calls.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider updating the `inflationMultiplier` using the `rebase()` function internally before computing `_amount` to get the currently value.
