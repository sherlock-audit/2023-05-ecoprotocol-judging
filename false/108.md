# L2ECOBridge.withdrawTo() should check if the `_to` address is a contract

## Summary
The sanity check against the `_to` address is missed, leading to potential token loss.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`withdrawTo()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L2ECOBridge.sol#L132) fails to check the `_to` address such that users could accidentally withdraw ERC20s to a contract, which leads to potential token loss.

## Impact

Users may accidentally withdraw ERC20s to contracts.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function withdrawTo(
        address _l2Token,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _l1Gas,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external virtual isL2EcoToken(_l2Token) {
        _initiateWithdrawal(msg.sender, _to, _amount, _l1Gas, _data);
    }
```

## Recommendation

Check if the `_to` address is a contract.
