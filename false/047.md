# Users can lose funds if `finalizeDeposit()` fails

## Summary

`finalizeDeposit()` does not have a callback to return funds in case of failed transactions.

## Vulnerability Detail

If for example `_l2Gas` sent is not enough, or any other mistake happens like using a invalid token address or `_to = address(0x0)`
there is no callback to `finalizeERC20Withdrawal()` in order to return the funds on the other chain like `initiateWithdrawal()`has.
So funds remain stuck in L1 bridge.


## Impact

Users will get their tokens stuck in the bridge.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement callback on failure like exemplified in the [sample contract](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/95978376a208e24a3ad03ba816dca89ae95a08dd/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/messaging/L2StandardBridge.sol#L88-L132) provided by Optimism.
