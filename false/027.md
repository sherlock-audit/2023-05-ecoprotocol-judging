# XDZIBEC-Arbitrary Role Assignment Vulnerability in L2ECO Token Contract

## Summary

The vulnerability lies in the initialize function, where the `tokenRoleAdmin` address is set to the `_l2Bridge` address without any proper validation or checks. 
This means that anyone who deploys the contract can potentially become the` tokenRoleAdmin` and gain unauthorized control over the minting, burning, and `rebasing `functionalities of the contract.
By manipulating the` tokenRoleAdmin` address, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform unauthorized actions such as creating or destroying tokens, as well as manipulating the inflation multiplier. This can have severe consequences for the token ecosystem and its users.

## Vulnerability Detail

```SOLIDITY
   function initialize(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Bridge
    ) public initializer {
        ERC20Upgradeable.__ERC20_init(
            "ECO",
            "ECO"
        );
        linearInflationMultiplier = INITIAL_INFLATION_MULTIPLIER;
        minters[_l2Bridge] = true;
        burners[_l2Bridge] = true;
        rebasers[_l2Bridge] = true;
        l1Token = _l1Token;
        tokenRoleAdmin = _l2Bridge;
    }
```

 The `initialize` function, the `tokenRoleAdmin` address is set to the` _l2Bridge` address without any validation. 
This means that anyone deploying the contract can easily manipulate the `tokenRoleAdmin` address and take control over crucial permissions, since there are no checks or restrictions on who can become the `tokenRoleAdmin`, 
An attacker can simply deploy the contract and become the all-powerful admin with unrestricted access to minting, burning, and `rebasing` functions, with control over the `tokenRoleAdmin` address, the attacker can maliciously mint an unlimited number of tokens, burn existing tokens at will, or manipulate the inflation multiplier, causing chaos in the token ecosystem.
This vulnerability compromises the security and integrity of the token contract, as unauthorized individuals can gain control over critical operations and exploit them for personal gain or disrupt the token's functionality.
It is crucial to implement proper checks and validations in the initialize function. This should include verifying the identity and authorization of the `tokenRoleAdmin` address, ensuring that only trusted and authorized entities can assume this role.

## Impact

-HERE IS A `POC `FOR THE VULNERABILITY A REAL SCENARIO :

1. Deploy the vulnerable token contract on the` Ethereum network`.
2.Obtain the address of the `_l2Bridge` contract, which will become the `tokenRoleAdmin`.
3.Use your ill-gotten power as the` tokenRoleAdmin` to mint an obscene amount of tokens. Just go crazy, create as many tokens as   
   your greedy heart desires.
4.Start flooding the market with your freshly minted tokens, causing massive inflation and devaluing the entire token ecosystem.
5. Manipulate the inflation multiplier to your advantage. Pump it up to skyrocket the token supply, or bring it down to crash the value.
6.Watch as chaos ensues, investors panic, and the token's reputation crumbles.
7.If you're feeling particularly evil, you can also burn existing tokens at will, destroying people's investments and further destabilizing 
  the ecosystem.
SO :
- With control over the` tokenRoleAdmin` address, the attacker becomes the supreme ruler of the token. They can mint an infinite supply of tokens and manipulate the market to their advantage. They can create massive sell-offs, crash the price, and accumulate tokens at rock-bottom prices. It's a feast for their twisted desires.
-The attacker can play the market like a puppeteer. They can create artificial demand by minting tokens and orchestrating buying frenzies, only to crash the price by dumping their own stash

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this vulnerability here's a suggested modification to the `initialize` function:

```solidity 
function initialize(address _l1Token, address _l2Bridge) public initializer {
    ERC20Upgradeable.__ERC20_init("ECO", "ECO");
    linearInflationMultiplier = INITIAL_INFLATION_MULTIPLIER;
    minters[_l2Bridge] = true;
    burners[_l2Bridge] = true;
    rebasers[_l2Bridge] = true;
    l1Token = _l1Token;
    // Only allow a trusted contract or address to become the tokenRoleAdmin
    require(isTrusted(_l2Bridge), "Invalid _l2Bridge address");
    tokenRoleAdmin = _l2Bridge;
}

function isTrusted(address _address) internal view returns (bool) {
    // Implement your own logic to determine if an address is trusted
    // This could involve a whitelist of approved addresses or other checks
    // Return true if the address is trusted, false otherwise
    // Example:
    // return whitelist[_address];
    // You need to define and populate the whitelist mapping separately
}

```
