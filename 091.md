# Discrepancy in `inflationMultiplier` value between L1 and L2 cause unequal number of tokens locked in L1 and L2 contracts

## Summary
`inflationMultiplier` is used to follow the linear rebasing mechanism of the ECO token when bridging assets from L1 to L2 and vice versa. This causes an issue during withdrawal of funds from L2 to L1 that the `inflationMultiplier` can be different in both the chains and since `inflationMultiplier` is used to calculate the amount of tokens to be burnt on L2/tokens to receive on L1 during finalizeWithdrawal, there will be unequal number of tokens locked in L1 and L2.

## Vulnerability Detail
Optimism takes roughly 7 days to complete the withdrawal process from L2 to L1 and. The `_linearInflation` coefficient in ECO.sol on L1 is updated by the trustees every 2 weeks. `inflationMultiplier` get updated everytime `rebase()` is being called on L1ECOBridge.sol and sends the message to L2 to update the `inflationMultiplier` on L2ECOBridge.sol.

This means the value of `inflationMultiplier` on L2 is completely dependent on when the rebase() will be called on L1 which means that discrepancies of this value is a possibility that needs to be kept in mind

Lets assume at the time of withdrawal: 
`inflationMultiplier` on L1 = ifL1 = 1 
`inflationMultiplier` on L2 = ifL2 = 1 
Tokens locked in L1  = 1000
Tokens on L2  = 1000

Amount being withdrawn from L2 = 100
After the withdrawal call on L2,
Tokens locked in L1  = 1000
Tokens on L2  = 900

the withdrawal message sent to L1 says that 100 * 1 = 100 tokens needs to be transferred/withdrawn from the L1ECOBridge.sol to the specified user in the message
 
During the withdrawal period of optimism, the `inflationMultiplier` is updated on L1 and then updated on L2. But when withdrawal was called, the old `inflationMultiplier` value was used to calculate the number of tokens to be transferred/withdrawn. When the message reaches L1, the new `inflationMultiplier` value is calculate the exact number of tokens to be transferred/withdrawn to the specified user.

Scenario 1: `inflationMultiplier` value goes down
Tokens burnt on L2 = 100 * ifL2 = 100 * 1 = 100
Updated `inflationMultiplier` on L1 = nifL1 = 0.9

Tokens to be transferred on L1 = 100 * 0.9 = 90

Post withdrawal amount of funds in L1 and L2 contracts
Tokens locked in L1  = 910
Tokens on L2  = 900

Tokens locked in L1 > Tokens on L2 which means that some of those tokens would stay locked inside the bridge contract forever because there is no way to release them without burning L2 tokens. 

Scenario 1: `inflationMultiplier` value goes up
Tokens burnt on L2 = 100 * ifL2 = 100 * 1 = 100
Updated `inflationMultiplier` on L1 = nifL1 = 1.1

Tokens to be transferred on L1 = 100 * 1.1 = 110

Post withdrawal amount of funds in L1 and L2 contracts
Tokens locked in L1  = 890
Tokens locked in L2  = 900

Tokens locked in L1 < Tokens on L2 which means that some users would be unable to bridge their assets back to L1. Instead of a trusted bridge, we would essentially recreate fractional reserve banking.
 
## Impact
Funds will either be locked on L1/L2 forever and will be irretrievable

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Insert `inflationMultiplier` value used to calculate the amount burnt on L2 to the withdrawal message and use this `inflationMultiplier` value to calculate the amount to be transferred on L1
