# Underpaying Optimism `_l2gas` may lead to loss of funds

## Summary

Underpaying Optimism l2gas on L1ECOBridge may lead to loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The L1ECOBridge.sol contract uses Optimism’s bridge with user-provided `_l2gas`. Optimism’s standard token bridge makes the cross-chain deposit by sending a [cross-chain message](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/master/packages/contracts/contracts/L1/messaging/L1StandardBridge.sol#L114-L123) to L2Bridge. If the `_l2Gas` is underpaid, finalizeDeposit will fail and user funds will be lost.
