# L2ECOBridge.withdraw() should apply onlyEOA

## Summary
The `onlyEOA` modifier is missed in `L2ECOBridge.withdraw()`

## Vulnerability Detail
[`withdraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L2ECOBridge.sol#L120) fails to apply `onlyEOA` such that users can `withdraw()` ERC20s to contracts, which leads to possible token loss accidentally.

## Impact
Users may accidentally withdraw ERC20s to contracts

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function withdraw(
        address _l2Token,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _l1Gas,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external virtual isL2EcoToken(_l2Token) {
        _initiateWithdrawal(msg.sender, msg.sender, _amount, _l1Gas, _data);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check if the `msg.sender` is a contract
