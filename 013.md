# Due to the asynchrony of cross-chain messages, users lose or make profits

## Summary

l1Eco has been deployed on [[mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8dBF9A4c99580fC7Fd4024ee08f3994420035727)](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8dBF9A4c99580fC7Fd4024ee08f3994420035727). EOA updates linearInflation via `l1Eco.notifyGenerationIncrease` which internally checks whether it can be updated. The calls between `l1Eco.notifyGenerationIncrease` and `L1ECOBridge.depositERC20` have a time interval, and sending cross-chain messages is asynchronous. In this way, two situations may occur:

1.  user maybe get less token.
2.  user maybe get more token.

## Vulnerability Detail

Due to the asynchronous nature of cross-chain messages, some later messages may be processed earlier.

Suppose linearInflation is updated from 1e18 to 2e18. The calling sequence is as follows:

1.  EOA calls `l1Eco.notifyGenerationIncrease`, linearInflation becomes 2e18. At this time, `L1ECOBridge.inflationMultiplier` and `L2ECOBridge.inflationMultiplier` are still 1e18. Bob noticed this tx.
2.  Bob calls `L1ECOBridge.depositERC20` to deposit 100e18 l1Eco. This function internally calls `sendCrossDomainMessage` send calldata into L2, encoding `amount=100e18*L1ECOBridge.inflationMultiplier=100e36`.
3.  EOA calls `L1ECOBridge.rebase`. This function internally updates `L1ECOBridge.inflationMultiplier` to 2e18, and calls `sendCrossDomainMessage` to send a message to update `IL2ECOBridge.inflationMultiplier`.Â 
4.  **If the interval between the calls of the 2 step and the 3 step is very small, and sending off-chain messages is asynchronous, it is possible that the message of the 3 step will arrive earlier than the message of the 2 step.**
5.  **`L2ECOBridge.rebase` is called, and `L2ECOBridge.inflationMultiplier` is updated to 2e18.**
6.  **`L2ECOBridge.finalizeDeposit` is called to handle bob's deposit. `_amount=100e36/2e18=50e18`. Bob got 50e18 l2Eco.**

Bob lossed 50e18 l2Eco. **On the contrary**, if the linearInflation becomes smaller than before, bob will get more token.

## Impact

When rebasing, users may suffer losses or arbitrage.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to encode the respective `inflationMultiplier` when sending `IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit` message and `IL1ERC20Bridge.finalizeERC20Withdrawal` message. When the message is processed, compare the `inflationMultiplier` of the two bridges for scaling.
