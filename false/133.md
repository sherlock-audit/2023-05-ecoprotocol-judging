# Initiates bridging of 0 amount of tokens and allows minting & burning 0 tokens.

## Summary
Initiates bridging of 0 amount of tokens in `_initiateERC20Deposit` and the `burn` & `mint` functions allow minting & burning 0 tokens in `L2ECO` contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is there is not a single check in the entire flow of the logic, makes it easy to mint/burn 0 tokens. The `_initiateERC20Deposit` accepts 0 for token amount and continues with the bridging process.

## Impact
I cannot describe serious impact, but it's easy to mint, burn and bridge 0 tokens, which definitely should not be allowed. Could result in unnecessary high gas costs and loss for the user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add this before `_initiateERC20Deposit` and _mint & _burn function calls:

```solidity
require(_amount > 0, "No zero amount")
```
