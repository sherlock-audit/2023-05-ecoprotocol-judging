# EIP712 domain separator is not initialized

## Summary

The `L2ECO` contract is `EIP712Upgradeable`, however, the domain separator is left uninitialized.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `EIP712Upgradeable` contract needs to be initialized, otherwise the EIP712 domain is not reliable, as it will be missing name and version.

## Impact
 
The EIP712 spec is not followed, and the domain separator is not reliable.
