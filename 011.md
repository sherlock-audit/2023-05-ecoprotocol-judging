# Loss of funds for user if inflationMultiplier increases while reverting transaction is pending

## Summary
When the token inflationMultiplier increases, all currently pending transactions from layer2 to layer1, that will revert for any reason, will cause loss of tokens for the User.

Possible reasons for a revert could be following:
- ECO token is paused, this can happen for various reasons
- In edge cases where someone try's to withdrawal more tokens then the bridge holds, (this is unlikely)

## Vulnerability Detail
The governance of the ECO protocol can vote onChain to modify the inflation multiplier, which is a process known as rebase. 
During this process, all contracts are updated to utilize the new inflation multiplier. 

However, since the bridge sends tokens based on the inflation-corrected amount, it needs to recalculate the actual amount being sent. This situation gives rise to the following problem: 

Lets imagine some user sends a transaction from layer2 to layer1. 
He sends 100 tokens, the inflationMultiplier is 10.

```solidity
// Construct calldata for l1TokenBridge.finalizeERC20Withdrawal(_to, _amount)
        _amount = _amount * inflationMultiplier;
        bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            //call parent interface of IL1ECOBridge to get the selector
            IL1ERC20Bridge.finalizeERC20Withdrawal.selector,
            l1Eco,
            l2Eco,
            _from,
            _to,
            _amount,
            _data
        );
```
Inside of _initiateWithdrawal() the amount to send will be multiplied by the Inflation Multiplier.
Now the token amount is 1000.

After the waiting period for the transaction, finalizeERC20Withdrawal() on layer 1 will be called.
```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory returnData) = _l1Token.call{value: 0}(
            _ecoTransferMessage
        );

        // make sure that the call to transfer didn't revert or return false
        if (success && abi.decode(returnData, (bool))) {
            // if successful, emit an event
            emit ERC20WithdrawalFinalized(
                _l1Token,
                _l2Token,
                _from,
                _to,
                _amount,
                _data
            );
        } else {
            // if the transfer fails, create a return tx
```
If now for any reason the transaction reverts, the finalizeERC20Withdrawal() function will send a new return transaction.
It will send the 1000 tokens back.

If the Inflation multiplier has change to 11, on layer2 the return transaction will calculate less tokens to mint:
```solidity
        _amount = _amount / inflationMultiplier;
        L2ECO(_l2Token).mint(_to, _amount);
        emit DepositFinalized(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);
```

Now the user got 90 (1000 / 11) instead of 100 tokens back. 

## Impact

Loss of funds for user if inflationMultiplier increases while reverting transaction is pending.

## Recommendation
Consider sending the inflation multiplier with the layer2 to layer1 transaction. After the layer1 transaction reverts, calculate the minted amount in finalizeDeposit() on layer2 with the old inflation multiplier.
