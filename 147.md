# Refunding will always revert

## Summary
The refunding mechanisim in `L1ECOBridge` will always revert because zero gas is sent as a parameter of the crossdomain message.

## Vulnerability Detail
In [`L1ECOBridge`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L280), in case the withdrawal of ECO to L1 fails, then there is a refunding mechanism that should send the amount of ECO tokens back to L2 so that the user will get its tokens on L2 back.

The issue is that the `_minGasLimit` parameter is set to 0:

```solidity
sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, 0, message);
```
The messenger will fail because the `OptimismPortal` requires a minimum amount of gas for deposits (see [here](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/12e782df03fb922e2a9a99ac148e4794426cc47e/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#L453)), and zero will never be enough.

## Impact
When the ECO token on L1 is paused, the withdrawal will be stuck into the bridge instead of being refunded as expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a constant value of minimum gas for relaying the refund message.
```diff
-   sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, 0, message);
+   sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, MIN_REFUND_GAS, message);
```
