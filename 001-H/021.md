# L1 and L2 inflation multipliers can be out of sync after deployment/initialization

## Summary

When deployed and initialized, there are no assurances in place that guarantee the inflation multiplier is the same across L1 and L2.

Therefore, if the existing L1 ECO token has an inflation multiplier that is anything other than `1e18`. The value of the `inflationMultiplier` will differ across L1 and L2. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Because of the way the contracts are architected, and as made evident in the deployment script, the `L1ECOBridge` is the last contract to be initialized. As part of it's initialization it gets the current inflation multiplier from the L1 ECO token and writes it into the `inflationMultiplier` state variable.

```solidity
    function initialize(
        address _l1messenger,
        address _l2TokenBridge,
        address _l1Eco,
        address _l2Eco,
        address _l1ProxyAdmin,
        address _upgrader
    ) public initializer {
        CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable.__CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable_init(_l1messenger);
        l2TokenBridge = _l2TokenBridge;
        l1Eco = _l1Eco;
        l2Eco = _l2Eco;
        l1ProxyAdmin = ProxyAdmin(_l1ProxyAdmin);
        upgrader = _upgrader;
        inflationMultiplier = IECO(_l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(block.number);
    }
```    

The L2 token and bridge, however, are initialized with the `INITIAL_INFLATION_MULTIPLIER` which is hard-coded to `1e18`.

This means that if the L1 ECO token has an inflation multiplier that is anything other than `1e18`, the value of the `inflationMultiplier` will then differ across L1 and L2.

## Impact

In this state with differing inflation multipliers, the exchange rate between L1 and L2 ECO tokens will be different. The deposit will be finalized at a different rate than it was initiated with which will result in a gain/loss of value when the `inflationMultiplier` eventually is synced via a rebase.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

As part of `L1ECOBridge` initialization, a call should be made to `rebase()` to ensure the `inflationMultiplier` is synced across L1 and L2.

```diff
    function initialize(
        address _l1messenger,
        address _l2TokenBridge,
        address _l1Eco,
        address _l2Eco,
        address _l1ProxyAdmin,
        address _upgrader
    ) public initializer {
        CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable.__CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable_init(_l1messenger);
        l2TokenBridge = _l2TokenBridge;
        l1Eco = _l1Eco;
        l2Eco = _l2Eco;
        l1ProxyAdmin = ProxyAdmin(_l1ProxyAdmin);
        upgrader = _upgrader;
-       inflationMultiplier = IECO(_l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(block.number);
+       rebase();
    }
```  

Note that `rebase()` will need to be marked `public` for this.
