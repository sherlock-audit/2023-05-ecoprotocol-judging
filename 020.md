# Incorrect modifier usage in L1EcoBridge.sol

## Summary

onlyEOA() modifier require can be bypassed

## Vulnerability Detail

onlyEOA() modifier is used to restrict the calls to a function for smart contracts. The contract is using the similar method to determine whether it's EOA account or smart contract as Address.sol library: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Address.sol#L45. However, this is not sufficient because once you're running the code from the constructor its bytecode is still 0. So this check will return true and allow smart contract to call the function.

## Impact

depositERC20() can be called from smart contract account.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's better to use tx.origin to make sure that the caller is EOA because only EOA can initiate the transaction.
