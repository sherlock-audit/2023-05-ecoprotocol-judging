# User tokens can be locked on the `L1ECOBridge` contract

## Summary
Users tokens can be locked on the `L1ECOBridge` contract due to unexpected revert in the `_mint` function in `ERC20Upgradable.sol`.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are a couple of possible reasons for reverting in the `_mint` function: overflow or address(0) as a target address.
The most expected is the choosing address(0) as `_to` argument in the `depositERC20To` function. The protocol policy is reverting all transfers to address(0) https://docs.eco.org/core-concepts/token-specification/eco-token#4.-revert-on-transfer-approval-to-zero-address. So it can be considered as wrong behavior.

## Impact
Tokens will be locked on the `L1ECOBridge`. It is not expected behavior for the standard bridge. https://ethereum.org/ph/developers/tutorials/optimism-std-bridge-annotated-code/#erc-20-tokens-on-l2
Also the protocol policy will be violated.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I suggest checking the target address in the  `depositERC20To` function.
