# User assets may become locked within the contract.

## Summary
Solidity's uint256 data type limitation prevents users from directly inputting fractional values in smart contracts.The untransferred fractional portion of tokens becomes locked within the contract, requiring additional actions to handle these fractions accurately.

## Vulnerability Detail
Inside the `ERC20Upgradeable._transfer()` function, the `_beforeTokenTransfer()` function is called to perform any pre-transfer logic and potentially modify the transfer amount.  The modified amount is stored in the `gonsAmount` variable.
```solidity
 function _transfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal virtual {
        require(from != address(0), "ERC20: transfer from the zero address");
        require(to != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");

        uint256 gonsAmount = _beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);

        uint256 fromBalance = _balances[from];
        require(fromBalance >= gonsAmount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance");
        unchecked {
```
As the code below ,the amount is multiplied by `linearInflationMultiplier` (1e18)to adjust the token amount based on a linear inflation factor.Since Solidity does not support native floating-point types, users can only input integer values when performing transactions. For example, if a user intends to transfer an amount of 1.5 * 1e18 tokens, they can only input 1 as the value, and the remaining 0.5 * 1e18 tokens will be locked within the smart contract.
```solidity
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal virtual override returns(uint256) {
        amount = super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
        // overwrite for efficiency
        amount = amount * linearInflationMultiplier;

        emit BaseValueTransfer(from, to, amount);
        return amount;
    }

```

## Impact
The untransferred fractional portion of tokens will remain locked within the contract until additional transactions are performed to handle those fractions appropriately.
