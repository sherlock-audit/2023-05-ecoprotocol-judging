# Missing `onlyEOA` modifier on `depositERC20To` function.

## Summary
There is no `onlyEOA` modifier on `depositERC20To` function, but it is on `depositERC20`

## Vulnerability Detail

The comments says "Used to stop deposits from contracts (avoid accidentally lost tokens)" and uses it for `depositERC20` fuction.

```solidity
/**
     * @dev Modifier requiring sender to be EOA.  This check could be bypassed by a malicious
     * contract via initcode, but it takes care of the user error we want to avoid.
     */
    modifier onlyEOA() {
        // Used to stop deposits from contracts (avoid accidentally lost tokens)
        require(msg.sender.code.length == 0, "L1ECOBridge: Account not EOA");
        _;
    }
```

The only change `depositERC20To` is that it deposits tokens to specified address.
So it still needs to "stop deposits from contracts (avoid accidentally lost tokens)" as specified.

## Impact
Not using `onlyEOA` won't stop deposits from contracts.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
function depositERC20To(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _l2Gas,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external virtual onlyEOA isL1EcoToken(_l1Token) isL2EcoToken(_l2Token) {
...
}
