# Different inflationMultipliers on contracts deployed (2 bridges)

## Summary
there will be a difference of the inflationMultiplier a contract deployed variables of L2ECOBridge and L1ECOBridge
## Vulnerability Detail
in fact the inflationMultiplier will be set to 
```solidity
IECO(_l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(
            block.number
        ); 
```
inside L1ECOBridge while inside L2ECOBridge it will be 1e18 (INITIAL_INFLATION_MULTIPLIER)
## Impact
this will cause the first withdraws and deposits to be wrong between Layer1 and 2, until the rebase function of the L1ECOBridge is called

## Tool used
VSCode

## Recommendation
call rebase in the L1ECOBridge constructor so that will set the inflationMultiplier the same in the two L1/L2 ECOBridges contracts
