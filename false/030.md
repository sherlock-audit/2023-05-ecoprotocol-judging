# `L2ECOBridge.withdraw` will result in a loss of funds if called by a contract

## Summary

If a contract initiates a withdraw via the `withdraw` function, the funds will we sent to an unowned address.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `withdraw` function in L2ECOBridge is defined as follows...

```solidity
    function withdraw(address _l2Token, uint256 _amount, uint32 _l1Gas, bytes calldata _data)
        external
        virtual
        isL2EcoToken(_l2Token)
    {
        _initiateWithdrawal(msg.sender, msg.sender, _amount, _l1Gas, _data);
    }
```

The issue is that if this is called by a contract, the `_to` address in `_initiateWithdrawal` will the the contract address. The `_to` address is the account to give the withdrawal to on L1, which in this case is all but guaranteed to not be owned by anyone.

On, `L1ECOBridge.deposit` there is an `onlyEOA` that protects against this. However, there is no such protection on `L2ECOBridge.withdraw`.

## Impact

If a contract uses the withdraw function, the funds will be sent to an unowned L1 address, lost.
