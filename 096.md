# The rebase function doesn't allow rebase action

## Summary
The rebase function doesn't allow rebasing tokens and not even callable by the rebasers role addresses - _l2Bridge.

## Vulnerability Detail
The rebase function will always throw an error (L2ECO: not authorized to rebase) because of the wrong onlyRebaserRole modifier.

In the onlyRebaserRole modifier, "msg.sender" is written inside "rebasers" instead of "_l2Bridge". "_l2Bridge" sets "rebasers" to true in the initialize function. The onlyRebaserRole modifier is set to false by default. The reason "rebasers" in the modifier should have "_l2Bridge" and not "msg.sender".

As it stands, no address can pass the check so far rebasers remain false in the mapping.

## Impact
The contract can't rebase tokens for all addresses. This will introduce a great flaw to the design of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Pass the initialialized "_l2Bridge" to rebasers in the onlyRebaserRole modifier like so:

modifier onlyRebaserRole() {
require(minters[_l2Bridge], "L2ECO: not authorized to rebase");
_;
}
