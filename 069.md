# L2ECO.burn can lock funds in the L1 bridge and lose valuation peg

## Summary
Any L2ECO holder is able to directly (rather than via bridge withdrawal) burn tokens, reducing the token supply on L2  without corresponding reduction on L1.

## Vulnerability Detail

As a bridge that mints and burns L2 tokens, users may see the external `L2ECO.burn()` function as a viable path to unlocking tokens on L1. This is permitted but does not result in ECO tokens being unlocked & transferred on L1. Instead, the L2ECO tokens are burned and the corresponding ECO tokens remain locked in the L1 bridge contract's balance.

This appears to have come from the original ECO contract [where it restricts (non-admin) users to burning their own tokens](https://github.com/helix-foundation/currency/blob/6faf5b8abd4444afd6206b7d80c82dead7049e4c/contracts/currency/ECO.sol#L58). However, on the L2 side this poses a risk. From [documentation for the Optimism standard bridge](https://ethereum.org/ml/developers/tutorials/optimism-std-bridge-annotated-code/) which the ECO bridge is based on:

- Regarding `mint()` and `burn()`: "The bridge should be the only entity that can run these functions to ensure the number of tokens is correct (equal to the number of tokens locked on L1)."
- "If there are too many tokens on L1, some of those tokens would stay locked inside the bridge contract forever because there is no way to release them without burning L2 tokens."

## Impact
Value of tokens burned directly by user on L2 is lost because corresponding L1 tokens are locked in the bridge with no way to salvage such funds (currently). Reducing the total supply of L2ECO token but not ECO token leads to **a difference in valuation** that is contrary to the purpose of the bridge and could result in L2ECO price "depegging" from ECO. 

## Code Snippet
[L2ECO.sol onlyBurnRoleOrSelf modifier](https://github.com/eco-association/op-eco/blob/39f205fb46eea3df770f0119a890ffdc1ac8f382/contracts/token/L2ECO.sol#L106-L112):
```javascript
    modifier onlyBurnerRoleOrSelf(address _from) {
        require(
            _from == msg.sender || burners[msg.sender],
            "L2ECO: not authorized to burn"
        );
        _;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change
```javascript
   modifier onlyBurnerRoleOrSelf(address _from) {
         require(
            _from == msg.sender || burners[msg.sender],
```
to
```javascript
   modifier onlyBurnerRole(address _from) {
         require(burners[msg.sender],
```
Allowing `_from == msg.sender` is not required for the bridge since its `burn()` call survives the `burners[msg.sender]` check.
