# Front-running rebase() call allow to increase token balance

## Summary

Front-running rebase() call allow to increase token balance.

## Vulnerability Detail

During bridging tokens between L1 and L2 user's "original" token balance is multiplied  by `inflationMultiplier`, the result named `gonsAmount` is equal to the token balance on L2. During withdrawing tokens from L2 to L1 `gonsAmount` is divided by `inflationMultiplier` and the appropriate amount is sent to the user's address:

```solidity
File: L1ECOBridge.sol
321:     function _initiateERC20Deposit(
...
334:         // gons move across the bridge, with inflation multipliers on either side to correctly scale balances
335:         _amount = _amount * inflationMultiplier;
336:  
337:         // Construct calldata for _l2Token.finalizeDeposit(_to, _amount)
338:         bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
339:             //call parent interface IL2ERC20Bridge to get the selector
340:             IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector,
341:             _l1Token,
342:             _l2Token,
343:             _from,
344:             _to,
345:             _amount,
346:             _data
347:         );
348: 
349:         // Send calldata into L2
350:         sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, _l2Gas, message);

File: L2ECOBridge.sol
145:     function finalizeDeposit(
...
159:         // When a deposit is finalized, we convert the transferred gons to ECO using the current
160:         // inflation multiplier, then we credit the account on L2 with the same amount of tokens.
161:         _amount = _amount / inflationMultiplier; 
162:         L2ECO(_l2Token).mint(_to, _amount);
163:         emit DepositFinalized(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);
164:     }
```

This works correctly in the case when `inflationMultiplier` is equal and this would be true most of the time.
However, L1Bridge also has the functionality to update `inflationMultiplier` on both bridges using `rebase()` function. The problem is that since these transactions on two blockchains (L1 and L2) are not atomic with each other - `inflationMultiplier` value would be different on two layers for some period of time while an update on L2 would be executed. This could lead to the next scenario:

1. Attacker deposit 100 tokens from L1 to L2. The current attacker balance on L2 becomes 400 tokens (with "base" balance of 100) with current `inflationMultiplier` = 4 on both layers.
2. Someone calls `rebase()` function on L1Bridge. `inflationMultiplier` = 2 now on L1Bridge (or become soon if tx is still in mempool).
3. Attacker spot `rebase()` call on L1 and call withdraw on L2Bridge. Since `inflationMultiplier` is still 4 on L2 - `gonsAmount` on withdraw call would be 400.
4. Cross-chain messenger call L1Bridge with withdraw finalizing tx. Since `inflationMultiplier` is now 2 on L1 - the attacker receives 200 tokens, basically stealing some other locked tokens from the bridge.

## Impact

An attacker could inflate the token balance each time `inflationMultiplier` parameter changes. Using private relayers to call `rebase` function would not guarantee protection since there is still a possibility that the attacker would get block with tx sooner than a bridge. The attacker also could manage `rebase` call timing themself since it's an access-free function on L1Bridge.

## Recommendation

Consider sending a parameter with the "real" `amount` of tokens during L2 <> L1 calls instead of `gonsAmount`.
