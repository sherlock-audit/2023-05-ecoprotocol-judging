# Stale inflationMultiplier in L1ECOBridge

## Summary 

`L1ECOBridge::inflationMultiplier` is updated through `L1ECOBridge::rebase` on Ethereum, and it is used in `_initiateERC20Deposit` and `finalizeERC20Withdrawal` to convert between token amount and `_gonsAmount`. However, if `rebase` is not called in a timely manner, the `inflationMultiplier` value can be stale and inconsistent with the value of L1 ECO token during transfer, leading to incorrect token amounts in deposit and withdraw.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `inflationMultiplier` value is updated in `rebase` with an independent transaction on L1 as shown below:

```solidity
    function rebase(uint32 _l2Gas) external {
        inflationMultiplier = IECO(l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(block.number);
```

However, in both `_initiateERC20Deposit`, `transferFrom` is called before the `inflationMultiplier` is used, which can lead to inconsistent results if `rebase` is not called on time for the `inflationMultiplier` to be updated. The code snippet for `_initiateERC20Deposit` is as follows:

```solidity
        IECO(_l1Token).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);
        _amount = _amount * inflationMultiplier;
```
`finalizeERC20Withdrawal` has the same problem.

```solidity
        uint256 _amount = _gonsAmount / inflationMultiplier;
        bytes memory _ecoTransferMessage = abi.encodeWithSelector(IERC20.transfer.selector,_to,_amount);
```

The same problem does not exist in L2ECOBridge. Because the L2 rebase function updates inflationMultiplier and rebase l2Eco token synchronously.

```solidity
    function rebase(uint256 _inflationMultiplier)
        external
        virtual
        onlyFromCrossDomainAccount(l1TokenBridge)
        validRebaseMultiplier(_inflationMultiplier)
    {
        inflationMultiplier = _inflationMultiplier;
        l2Eco.rebase(_inflationMultiplier);
        emit RebaseInitiated(_inflationMultiplier);
    }
```

## Impact

The attacker can steal tokens with this.

He can deposit to L1 bridge when he observes a stale larger value and he will receive more tokens on L2.

## Recommendation

Calling `IECO(l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(block.number)` instead of using `inflationMultiplier`.
