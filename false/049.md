# Users will not get funds back in case of L1ECO token transfer failure.

## Summary
Not enough gas is provided in the callback to `finalizeDeposit()` in case _l1Token.transfer()` call fails.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to [docs](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/master/packages/contracts/contracts/L1/messaging/L1StandardBridge.sol#L169) "_l2Gas Gas limit required to complete the deposit on L2." from L1 bridge ,  while on [L2 this is not necessary](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/master/packages/contracts/contracts/L2/messaging/L2StandardBridge.sol#L83).

Ecos implementation however did the reverse and implemented `_gasLimit = 0` in L1 `finalizeERC20Withdrawal`.

That means if `_l1Token.transfer()` call fails, users wont get their deposit back because the `_gasLimit` to execute `finalizeDeposit()` on L2 will be zero, consequently the function won't be executed and the funds won't be returned.

## Impact
if `_l1Token.transfer()` call fails, users wont get their L2 funds back.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change zero to a value that allows `finalizeDeposit()` to be executed.
