# New implementation contracts should be checked that interfaces match with old implementation

## Summary
In `upgradeECO`, `upgradeSelf` and `upgradeL2Bridge` in `L1ECOBridge.sol` do not ensure that the implementations have all the correct functionality.
## Vulnerability Detail
I have labeled this as medium severity because it requires human error on the up-grader's side. However, if this does occur then it can cause the entire bridge to break.
## Impact
For example, if the incorrect address is specified then it would be impossible to upgrade as the `Proxy` will not have the correct logic to be able to call `proxyAdmin.upgrade()` thereby locking all user funds in the proxy forever.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `ERC165Checker.sol` to make sure that any new implementation supports the same functions, thereby massively decreasing the chances of human error.
