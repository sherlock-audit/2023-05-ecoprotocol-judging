# Inflation multiplier can change between initiating and finalizing L2 deposit breaking accounting

## Summary
This issue is similar to L2 withdrawal issue but is a bit more tricky. When bridging ECO from L1 to L2 a deposit may fail and then be replayed later. If rebasing happens between the original attempt and the replay, the value received by the user on L2 will be incorrect.

## Vulnerability Detail
When initiating a deposit in L1ECOBridge, the amount is converted into gons:
```solidity
_amount = _amount * inflationMultiplier;
```
When finalizing a deposit in L2ECOBridge, it is converted back to the underlying
```solidity
_amount = _amount / inflationMultiplier
```
Inflation modifier can change. When rebasing happens, L1 bridge contract sends a cross domain message to update the value on L2
```solidity
    function rebase(uint32 _l2Gas) external {
        inflationMultiplier = IECO(l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(
            block.number
        );

        bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            IL2ECOBridge.rebase.selector,
            inflationMultiplier
        );

        sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, _l2Gas, message);
    }
```

Usually, if deposit is initiated before rebasing, it will also arrive on L2 prior to the rebasing message, in which case the accounting will be correct. However, if deposit fails, say, due to low _l2Gas provided, the rebasing message will arrive first. The deposit then can be replayed

In this case, inflationMultiplier on L2 will be different from the one used when initiating a deposit. Bad actor can intentionally send a deposit with low gas and replay the message later, after favorable rebasing happens. For example:

Example:
- InflationMultiplier is 100
- User initiates a deposit of 10 tokens
- 1000 gons are recorded in the deposit request
- Due to low gas the deposit fails on L2
- Rebasing happens and inflationMultiplier is now 50
- User replays the deposit and receives 1000/50 = 20 tokens

## Impact
When depositing to Optimism, user will receive either more or less tokens than expected

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The simplest fix would be to track deposits in underlying amount instead of gons. 
Alternatively, inflationMultiplier can be stored in deposit _data and used when converting gons on L2
