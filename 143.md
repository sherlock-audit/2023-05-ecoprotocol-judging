# Inflation multiplier can change between initiating and finalizing L2 withdrawal breaking accounting

## Summary
ECO is a rebasing token. Bridge uses `inflationMultiplier` to keep track of rebasing coefficient. When recording a withdrawal, token amount is converted to gons using `inflationMultiplier`. When finalizing, gons are converted back to the underlying amount. Withdrawal period on Optimism is 7 days during which `inflationMultiplier` can change. As a result, user can receive more or less tokens than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail
When initiating withdrawal in L2ECOBridge.sol
```solidity
_amount = _amount * inflationMultiplier;
```
When finalizing in L1ECOBridge.sol
```solidity
uint256 _amount = _gonsAmount / inflationMultiplier;
```

The period between initiating and withdrawal is 7 days on Optimism. Let's say rebasing happened in-between and `inflationMultiplier` was changed.
```solidity
    function rebase(uint32 _l2Gas) external {
        inflationMultiplier = IECO(l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(
            block.number
        );
```

Now the amount received in L1ECOBridge will be incorrect. Example:
- InflationMultiplier is 100
- User initiates a withdrawal of 10 tokens
- 1000 gons are recorded in the withdrawal request
- Rebasing happens and inflationMultiplier is now 50
- Withdrawal is being finalized and user receives 1000/50 = 20 tokens

User balance on L2 was 100\*10=1000
User balance on L1 after withdrawal is 20\*50=1000
After rebasing, user balance should have decreased to 500 but it's still 1000. User benefited from the above scenario.

## Impact
User who makes a withdrawal will receive either less or more tokens than deserved

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I believe for simplicity bridging should be done with underlying amount instead of gons.
