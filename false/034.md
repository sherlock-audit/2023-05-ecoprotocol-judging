# The L2 bridge is made `tokenRoleAdmin` of the L2 ECO token but lacks the ability to call any admin functions

## Summary

When `L2ECO` is initialized, the `L2ECOBridge` is assigned as `tokenRoleAdmin`. However, the bridge lacks all ability to call any of the administrative functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

The L2 Eco token has a series of admin functions that are only called by `tokenRoleAdmin`. 

```solidity
    function updateMinters(address _key, bool _value) public onlyTokenRoleAdmin {
        minters[_key] = _value;
    }
    function updateBurners(address _key, bool _value) public onlyTokenRoleAdmin {
        burners[_key] = _value;
    }
    function updateRebasers(address _key, bool _value) public onlyTokenRoleAdmin {
        rebasers[_key] = _value;
    }
    function updateTokenRoleAdmin(address _newAdmin) public onlyTokenRoleAdmin {
        tokenRoleAdmin = _newAdmin;
    }
```

However, when initialized, the L2 bridge is made the `tokenRoleAdmin` but it does not actually have the ability to call any of those functions.

## Impact

This leaves the `L2ECO` contract in a state where important administrative actions cannot be taken.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include wrapper functions in the `L2ECOBridge` contract that allow the `L2ECOBridge` to call the administrative functions on the `L2ECO` contract.
