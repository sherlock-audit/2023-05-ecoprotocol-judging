# Minting and burning ecos exposes users to unlimited slippage

## Summary
The amount of ecos minted / assets received when minting or burning synths can be manipulated to an unlimited extent by manipulating the reserves of the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here a user sends a deposit to the L1bridge into _initiateERC20Deposit and the equivalent amount of foreignAsset is minted as a Eco to be sent to the user L2bridge as finalizeDeposit. However the user can't specify the minimum amount of eco that they would accept. A frontrunner can then manipulate the reserves of the L2bridge pool in order to make foreignAsset appear more valuable than it really is so the user receives ecos which are worth much less than what nativeDeposit is worth. This is equivalent to a swap without a slippage limit.

Burning ecos essentially runs the same process in behalf so manipulating the pool in the opposite direction will result in the user getting fewer of Eco's than they expect.

## Impact
Loss of user funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a argument for the minimum amount of synths to mint or nativeAsset to receive.
