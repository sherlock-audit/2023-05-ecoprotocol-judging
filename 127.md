# When the protocol is initially deployed, the inflationMultiplier for L1 and L2 may not be equal

## Summary
When the protocol is initially deployed, the inflationMultiplier for L1 and L2 may not be equal, and depositors may profit or lose due to this.
## Vulnerability Detail
The L1ECOBridge.rebase function is used to synchronize the inflationMultiplier of L1 and L2.
```solidity
    function rebase(uint32 _l2Gas) external {
        inflationMultiplier = IECO(l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(
            block.number
        );

        bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            IL2ECOBridge.rebase.selector,
            inflationMultiplier
        );

        sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, _l2Gas, message);
    }
```
However, at the time the protocol is deployed, L1.inflationMultiplier == _l1Eco.getPastLinearInflation(block.number),
```solidity
        inflationMultiplier = IECO(_l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(
            block.number
        );
```
L2.inflationMultiplier == INITIAL_INFLATION_MULTIPLIER == 1e18.
```solidity
        inflationMultiplier = l2Eco.INITIAL_INFLATION_MULTIPLIER();
```
If L1.inflationMultiplier is not equal to 1e18, the depositor may profit or lose as a result.

Consider L1.inflationMultiplier == 1.1e18, a depositor depositing 1000 l1Eco will mint 1000 * 1.1/1 = 1100 l2Eco, and when the inflationMultiplier is synchronized, the depositor can withdraw 1100 l1Eco.

Consider L1.inflationMultiplier == 0.9e18, the depositor depositing 1000 l1Eco will mint 1000 *0.9/1 = 900 l2Eco and when the inflationMultiplier is synchronized, the depositor can only withdraw 900 l1Eco.

## Impact
If L1.inflationMultiplier is not equal to 1e18, the depositor may profit or lose as a result.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider that deposits are allowed only after the first rebase is called to synchronize the inflationMultiplier of L1 and L2
