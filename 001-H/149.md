# Desynced rebase between L1 and L2 could lead to partly lost user funds or attacker gaining funds

## Summary
Desynced rebase between L1 and L2 could lead to partly lost user funds or attacker gaining funds

## Vulnerability Detail
### Scenario 1 - User loses funds
1. current value of inflation multiplier is `1e18`
2. proposal to modify the inflation multiplier to half of the initial value (`5e17`) passes
3. [eco.notifyGenerationIncrease()](https://github.com/helix-foundation/currency/blob/master/contracts/currency/ECO.sol#L66-L109) is called
4. mainnet inflation rate has been modified to `5e17`
5. alice deposits her funds (10e18) via `depositERC20()` of `L1EcoBridge.sol` just after a few seconds the inflation rate modification
6. `L2CrossDomainMessenger` calls `finalizeDeposit()` with `amount * inflationMultiplier` (it get's calculated in [_initiateERC20Deposit() L335](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L335))
7. However `rebase()` hasn't yet been called on L1 which means L2 rebase on `L2EcoBridge.sol` is still the past value (`1e18`)
8. Alice gets half of her deposited funds (`5e18`) minted to her due to the `amount / inflationRate` calculation in [finalizeDeposit() - L161](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L2ECOBridge.sol#L161)
9. Alice is angry that she lost half her tokens and demands a refund from the project

### Scenario 2 - Attacker gains funds
1. current value of inflation multiplier is `1e18`
2. proposal to modify the inflation multiplier to double of the initial value (`2e18`) passes
3. [eco.notifyGenerationIncrease()](https://github.com/helix-foundation/currency/blob/master/contracts/currency/ECO.sol#L66-L109) is called
4. mainnet inflation rate has been modified to `2e18`
5. bob immediately deposits his funds (`1000e18`) via `depositERC20()` of `L1EcoBridge.sol` after the modification
6. L2CrossDomainMessenger calls `finalizeDeposit()` with `amount * inflationMultiplier` (it get's calculated in [_initiateERC20Deposit() L335](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L335))
7. However `rebase()` hasn't yet been called on L1 which means L2 rebase on `L2EcoBridge.sol` is still the past value (1e18)
8. Bob gets double of his initially deposited funds (`2000e18`) in L2ECO minted due to the `amount / inflationRate` calculation in [finalizeDeposit() L161](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L2ECOBridge.sol#L161)
10. Bob is happy his exploit worked and sells the extra tokens for a profit

### High Severity Justification
I believe high severity is correct because of these factors that could enhance the exploit: the attacker could pass a malicious proposal to modify inflation rate to a significantly higher inflation multiplier value, meaning his profits could be substantially higher for little cost. For example `1e18` -> `10e18` modification would mean 1x cost for the attacker and 10x profit and this is just one execution of the attack. Profit can be sold and the attack can be replayed as many times as possible until `rebase()` is called.

## Impact
User loses his deposited funds or Attacker gains additional funds

## Code Snippet
[L1ECOBridge.sol - rebase()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L296-L307)

## Proof Of Concept
I initialized a foundry repo for mainnet fork testing on Optimism and Ethereum to test vulnerabilities. You have to have foundry installed but the test setup is relatively simple. The test demonstrates Scenario 1 where the user gets less funds than the deposited amount

1. Copy Eco Foundry Fork test repo and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xfuje/eco-audit-foundry-setup.git && cd eco-audit-foundry-setup && forge install
```

2. Change .env Mainnet fork variables to your Alchemy or Infura ID or (other RPC provider ID):
```bash
MAINNET_RPC_URL="https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR-ALCHEMY-MAINNET-ID"
OPTIMISM_RPC_URL="https://opt-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR-ALCHEMY-OPTIMISM-ID"
```

3. Copy the following code into test/EcoTestSetup.t.sol
```solidity
contract TestDesyncedRebase is EcoTestSetup {
    using stdStorage for StdStorage;

    function testDesyncedRebase() external {
        vm.selectFork(mainnetFork);

        // for ease of testing the following actions were simplified with foundry stdstore:
        // - proposal to modify inflation multiplier to 5e17 passes
        // - eco.notifyGenerationIncrease(); is called 
        // - mainnet inflation rate has been modified to 5e17

        stdstore
            .target(address(l1EcoBridge))
            .sig("inflationMultiplier()")
            .checked_write(5e17);

        // 2. alice deposits 10e18 eco
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        uint256 mainnetDepositedAmount = 10e18;

        eco.approve(address(l1EcoBridge), mainnetDepositedAmount);
        l1EcoBridge.depositERC20(
            address(eco),
            address(l2Eco),
            mainnetDepositedAmount,
            FINALIZATION_GAS,
            NON_NULL_BYTES32
        );
        vm.stopPrank();
        // 3. save l1 eco bridge inflation multiplier
        uint256 mainnetInflationMultiplier = l1EcoBridge.inflationMultiplier();

        // 3. bridge finalizes
        vm.selectFork(optimismFork);

        vm.prank(L2_OP_CROSS_DOMAIN_MESSENGER);
        l2EcoBridge.finalizeDeposit(
            address(eco),
            address(l2Eco),
            alice,
            alice,
            // amount is multiplied by inflation multiplier in l1 eco bridge initiateWithdrawal
            mainnetDepositedAmount * mainnetInflationMultiplier, // and divided in finalizeDeposit
            NON_NULL_BYTES32
        );
        
        uint256 optimismMintedAmount = l2Eco.balanceOf(alice);
        
        emit log_uint(mainnetDepositedAmount);
        emit log_uint(optimismMintedAmount);

        // optimism minted amount is half as much as mainnet deposited amount
        // due to the desynced rebase which is a big loss of funds for the unsuspecting user
        assertEq(mainnetDepositedAmount, optimismMintedAmount * 2);
    }
}
```

4. Run the test
```bash
forge test --match-test testDesyncedRebase -vvvv
```

## Tool used
Manual Review, Foundry, Mainnet Fork Tests

## Recommendation
Call `rebase()` of `L1ECOBridge.sol` in `ECO`'s contracts whenever a function modifies inflation rate.
