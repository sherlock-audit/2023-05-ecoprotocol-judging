# The `gasLimit` is zero when calling the `sendCrossDomainMessage` function

## Summary

If you send the ICrossDomainMessenger.sendMessage() function with a gas limit of 0, it will cause the transaction to revert immediately due to an "Out of Gas" error.

Since executing a transaction, including the sendMessage() function, requires a certain amount of gas, setting the gas limit to 0 means there is no gas allocated for the transaction's execution.

```solidity
File: contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L280
    // Send message up to L1 bridge
    sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, 0, message); // @here gasLimit is zero
    // Emit an event to signal success event listeners to expect failure
    emit WithdrawalFailed(
        _l1Token,
        _l2Token,
        _from,
        _to,
        _amount,
        _data
    );

```

## Impact

This prevents finalizing ERC20Withdrawal when the transfer of l1Token fails or reverts;

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Recommend adding the _l2Gas parameter in `finalizeERC20Withdrawal` function and updating the related call trace in (L2ECOBridge.sol). Use _l2Gas to send message to L2Bridge.
