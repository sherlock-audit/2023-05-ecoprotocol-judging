# Incorrect implementation of TransparentUpgradeableProxy pattern

## Summary
Proxy pattern implemented wrong hence there is no way to upgrade contracts because there is no ```TransparentUpgradeableProxy``` instance, hence ```upgrade``` function is actually empty.
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's start looking at [TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/transparent/TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol) from openzeppelin:
```solidity
/**
 * @dev Interface for {TransparentUpgradeableProxy}. In order to implement transparency, {TransparentUpgradeableProxy}
 * does not implement this interface directly, and some of its functions are implemented by an internal dispatch
 * mechanism. The compiler is unaware that these functions are implemented by {TransparentUpgradeableProxy} and will not
 * include them in the ABI so this interface must be used to interact with it.
 */
interface ITransparentUpgradeableProxy is IERC1967 {
    function admin() external view returns (address);

    function implementation() external view returns (address);

    function changeAdmin(address) external;

    function upgradeTo(address) external;

    function upgradeToAndCall(address, bytes memory) external payable;
}

...

/**
* Our recommendation is for the dedicated account to be an instance of the {ProxyAdmin} contract. If set up this way,
* you should think of the `ProxyAdmin` instance as the real administrative interface of your proxy.
* 
* NOTE: The real interface of this proxy is that defined in `ITransparentUpgradeableProxy`. This contract does not
* inherit from that interface, and instead the admin functions are implicitly implemented using a custom dispatch
* mechanism in `_fallback`. Consequently, the compiler will not produce an ABI for this contract. This is necessary to
* fully implement transparency without decoding reverts caused by selector clashes between the proxy and the
* implementation.
*
...
 */
contract TransparentUpgradeableProxy is ERC1967Proxy {
```
as we can see from the explanation and implementation of interface, in order to use ```upgrade``` functions we first need to create an instance of ```TransparentUpgradeableProxy``` contract, then call ```ProxyAdmin```'s ```upgrade``` function providing ```ITransparentUpgradeableProxy``` inside it. This way ProxyAdmin's call to upgrade will fall to ```_fallback``` function inside ```TransparentUpgradeableProxy``` and ```_dispatchUpgrade``` functions will be used to upgrade contracts.

Now let's see what is implemented in our contracts and what will these calls lead us to:
(Although this pattern exist in both ```L1ECOBridge.sol``` and ```L2ECOBridge.sol``` , we will do the walktrough in ```L1ECOBridge.sol```)

-First we create ```ProxyAdmin``` in [initializer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L113-L132)
```solidity
function initialize(
        address _l1messenger,
        address _l2TokenBridge,
        address _l1Eco,
        address _l2Eco,
        address _l1ProxyAdmin,
        address _upgrader
    ) public initializer {
        CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable.__CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable_init(
            _l1messenger
        );
        l2TokenBridge = _l2TokenBridge;
        l1Eco = _l1Eco;
        l2Eco = _l2Eco;
        l1ProxyAdmin = ProxyAdmin(_l1ProxyAdmin);
        upgrader = _upgrader;
        inflationMultiplier = IECO(_l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(
            block.number
        );
    }
```
- Now let's try to use [upgradeSelf](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L174-L184) function:
```solidity
function upgradeSelf(address _newBridgeImpl) external virtual onlyUpgrader {
        //cast to a payable address since l2EcoToken is the proxy address of a ITransparentUpgradeableProxy contract
        address payable proxyAddr = payable(address(this));

        ITransparentUpgradeableProxy proxy = ITransparentUpgradeableProxy(
            proxyAddr
        );
        l1ProxyAdmin.upgrade(proxy, _newBridgeImpl);

        emit UpgradeSelf(_newBridgeImpl);
    }
```
This function create ```ITransparentUpgradeableProxy``` instead of ```TransparentUpgradeableProxy``` and then use this interface inside ```ProxyAdmin```'s ```upgrade``` function.
- Let's now see what this [function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/transparent/ProxyAdmin.sol#L62-L64) does:
```solidity
function upgrade(ITransparentUpgradeableProxy proxy, address implementation) public virtual onlyOwner {
        proxy.upgradeTo(implementation);
    }
```
- It send us to [upgradeTo](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/transparent/TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol#L14-L24) function:
```solidity
interface ITransparentUpgradeableProxy is IERC1967 {
    function admin() external view returns (address);

    function implementation() external view returns (address);

    function changeAdmin(address) external;

    function upgradeTo(address) external;

    function upgradeToAndCall(address, bytes memory) external payable;
}
```
which doesn't have any meaning if there is no ```TransparentUpgradeableProxy``` implementation.

Now let's see where we would reach if we could implement that:
[TransparentUpgradeableProxy](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/transparent/TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol#L81-L107)
```solidity
/**
     * @dev If caller is the admin process the call internally, otherwise transparently fallback to the proxy behavior
     */
    function _fallback() internal virtual override {
        if (msg.sender == _getAdmin()) {
            bytes memory ret;
            bytes4 selector = msg.sig;
            if (selector == ITransparentUpgradeableProxy.upgradeTo.selector) {
                ret = _dispatchUpgradeTo();
            } else if (selector == ITransparentUpgradeableProxy.upgradeToAndCall.selector) {
                ret = _dispatchUpgradeToAndCall();
            } else if (selector == ITransparentUpgradeableProxy.changeAdmin.selector) {
                ret = _dispatchChangeAdmin();
            } else if (selector == ITransparentUpgradeableProxy.admin.selector) {
                ret = _dispatchAdmin();
            } else if (selector == ITransparentUpgradeableProxy.implementation.selector) {
                ret = _dispatchImplementation();
            } else {
                revert("TransparentUpgradeableProxy: admin cannot fallback to proxy target");
            }
            assembly {
                return(add(ret, 0x20), mload(ret))
            }
        } else {
            super._fallback();
        }
    }
```
then [TransparentUpgradeableProxy](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/transparent/TransparentUpgradeableProxy.sol#L151-L161)
```solidity
 /**
     * @dev Upgrade the implementation of the proxy.
     */
    function _dispatchUpgradeTo() private returns (bytes memory) {
        _requireZeroValue();

        address newImplementation = abi.decode(msg.data[4:], (address));
        _upgradeToAndCall(newImplementation, bytes(""), false);

        return "";
    }
```
then
[ERC1967Upgrade](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/ERC1967/ERC1967Upgrade.sol#L54-L64)
```solidity
/**
     * @dev Perform implementation upgrade with additional setup call.
     *
     * Emits an {Upgraded} event.
     */
    function _upgradeToAndCall(address newImplementation, bytes memory data, bool forceCall) internal {
        _upgradeTo(newImplementation);
        if (data.length > 0 || forceCall) {
            Address.functionDelegateCall(newImplementation, data);
        }
    }
```
then
[ERC1967Upgrade](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/ERC1967/ERC1967Upgrade.sol#L45-L52)
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Perform implementation upgrade
     *
     * Emits an {Upgraded} event.
     */
    function _upgradeTo(address newImplementation) internal {
        _setImplementation(newImplementation);
        emit Upgraded(newImplementation);
    }
```
and finally
[ERC1967Upgrade](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/ERC1967/ERC1967Upgrade.sol#L36-42)
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Stores a new address in the EIP1967 implementation slot.
     */
    function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) private {
        require(Address.isContract(newImplementation), "ERC1967: new implementation is not a contract");
        StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;
    }
```

## Impact
It is not possible to upgrade contracts. Which breaks one of the intended core functionalities of contracts.

## Recommendation
Change proxy implementation and don't forget to create ```TransparentUpgradeableProxy``` instance.
