# L2 upgrades are not rollback resistant

## Summary

Upgrades to both ECO token and the L2Bridge are initiated from the L1 bridge.

When an update transaction is received in L2 there is not validation of the version numbers.
This is problematic because Optimism has a replayability mechanism of failed L2 messages. 

## Vulnerability Detail

An upgrader can call the `L1ECOBridge` to upgrade either the ECO token or the L2 bridge itself:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#LL138C14-L138C24
```solidity
    function upgradeECO(address _impl, uint32 _l2Gas)
        external
        virtual
        onlyUpgrader
    {
        bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            IL2ECOBridge.upgradeECO.selector,
            _impl
        );

        sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, _l2Gas, message);
        emit UpgradeL2ECO(_impl);
    }

    /**
     * @inheritdoc IL1ECOBridge
     * @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow-reachable delegatecall
     */
    function upgradeL2Bridge(address _impl, uint32 _l2Gas)
        external
        virtual
        onlyUpgrader
    {
        bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            IL2ECOBridge.upgradeSelf.selector,
            _impl
        );

        sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, _l2Gas, message);
        emit UpgradeL2Bridge(_impl);
    }

```

In L2 the upgrade might not succeed/execute due to multiple reasons like insufficient gas or invalid implementation (can include bugs, etc..).
Therefore the upgrade message will be in the `L2CrossDomainMessenger` in the `failedMessage` array or not executed at all.

In such a case the upgrader can decide to push another update without executing the previous one.

Some time passes, and a malicious actor can use the `replayMessage` function to correctly execute the initial upgrade and override current implementation.

This can lead to potential loss of funds is cases where the L2 bridge is not aligned with the correct ECO.

## Impact

Potential loss of funds and denial of service.

## Recommendation

Since optimism messages are replayable it makes sense to have a versioning scheme to the contracts so they cannot be rolled back.

Check in the upgrade functions on L2 that the version supplied through the message is above current version of the contract.
