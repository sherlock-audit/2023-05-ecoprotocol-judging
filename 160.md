# L1 ECO tokens are locked permanently to L2ECOBridge contract


## Summary
User can burn his L2ECO token himself without L2ECOBridge involved, which means there is no way to withdraw L1ECO from L1ECOBridge.

## Vulnerability Detail
When user deposits at L1Bridge, the funds are locked to bridge and L2 tokens are minted on L2.
Now user can burn his L2ECO with `burn` method in L2ECO, as it is allowed to burn caller's assets.
Now there is no way to withdraw back from L1bridge, and L1ECOs are permernently locked.

## Impact
Funds locked permanently on mainnet

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/token/L2ECO.sol#L234-L246
```solidity
/**
  * @dev Burn tokens for an address. Only callable by burner role addresses
  * @param _from the address to lose tokens
  * @param _amount the amount of tokens to be destroyed
  */
function burn(address _from, uint256 _amount)
    external
    onlyBurnerRoleOrSelf(_from)
{
    _burn(_from, _amount);
    emit Burn(_from, _amount);
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
For L2ECO, there is no need to allow user to burn his tokens cause they can just withdraw.
If user burning is neccessary for future features, you can implement a way to unlock tokens at L1Bridge besides `finalizeWithdraw`.
But this can lead to centralization.
So that `emergencyWithdraw` function can withdraw at most (locked_funds - L2ECO_total).
