# Hardcoded 0 value for gasLimit could break withdrawal

## Summary

Hardcoded 0 value for gasLimit could break withdrawal.

## Vulnerability Detail

Withdrawing tokens from L2 to L1 requires finalizing on L1Bridge using `finalizeERC20Withdrawal` function. Cross-domain messenger calls L1Bridge and the last one attempt to transfer tokens to the receiver address. In case the transfer is not successful - the bridge would send the return tx back to L2Bridge which would return tokens to the sender address on L2:
 ```solidity
File: L1ECOBridge.sol
236:     function finalizeERC20Withdrawal( 
...
244:         uint256 _amount = _gonsAmount / inflationMultiplier;
245: 
246:         // equivalent to IECO(_l1Token).transfer(_to, _amount); but is revert safe
247:         bytes memory _ecoTransferMessage = abi.encodeWithSelector(
248:             IERC20.transfer.selector,
249:             _to,
250:             _amount
251:         );
252:         (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = _l1Token.call{value: 0}(
253:             _ecoTransferMessage
254:         );
255: 
256:         // make sure that the call to transfer didn't revert or return false
257:         if (success && abi.decode(returnData, (bool))) {
...
267:         } else {
268:             // if the transfer fails, create a return tx
269:             bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
270:                 IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector,
271:                 _l1Token,
272:                 _l2Token,
273:                 _to, // switched the _to and _from here to bounce back the deposit to the sender
274:                 _from,
275:                 _gonsAmount,
276:                 _data
277:             );
278: 
279:             // Send message up to L1 bridge
280:             sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, 0, message); 
...
```

`sendCrossDomainMessage` call here includes a 0 hardcoded value for `gasLimit` parameter. While Optimism docs declare that this parameter could be an arbitrary number now:
https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/messaging/#communication-basics-between-layers
It could not the case in the future or in the Base rollup. 

## Impact

Hardcoded 0 `gasLimit` could break the return transaction during an unsuccessful withdrawal from L2 to L1 leading to a loss of users tokens.

## Recommendation

Consider adding a parameter in a call to L2Bridge that specifies `gasLimit` for return tx from L1Bridge in case withdraw finalizing reverts.
