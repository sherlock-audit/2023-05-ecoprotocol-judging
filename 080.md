# Withdraw to address 0 is not reverting, but resulting in 2 XDomain Messages sent and tokens sent back.

## Summary

When someone initiates an withdraw on the bridge to `address(0)` it is not reverting. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Someone can `withdrawTo` in L2EcoBridge to withdraw funds to to the 0 address. 
This will burn the users Token on L2 and send the XChain Message to `L1ECOBridge`, where `finalizeERC20Withdrawal` is called.
Here the contract tries to transfer the L1 `ECO` token to address(0), which will fail because ECO token reverts on address(0).
Then the L1ECOBridge contract sends another CrossChain Message, back to the `L2ECOBridge` to `finalizeDeposit` with the switched `from` and `to` addresses. 

`from = address(0)` & `to = msg.sender` in our case. This results in our Tokens minted back to us and an `DepositFinalized` Event emitted.


## Impact

- Unneccessary use of gas, as we could revert early by checking for address(0) in `withdrawTo`
- Events get clobbered, as we are emitting `DepositFinalized` events for the back transfer(mint) of tokens which makes them useless for monitoring.
