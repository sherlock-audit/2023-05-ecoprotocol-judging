# STOPTHECAP - Calling L2ECO.rebase through a different rebaser than L2ECOBridge will result in a mismatch in the linearInflationMultiplier parameters of these two contracts

## Summary
Calling L2ECO.rebase through a rebaser other than L2ECOBridge will result in a mismatch in the linear inflation multiplier state variable of these two contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
L2ECO contains a mapping of trusted "rebasers" that have the ability to call L2ECO.rebase, which changes its linearInflationMultiplier. The initial rebaser is set to the L2ECOBridge, as the default update flow involves the L1ECOBridge sending a cross-domain message to the L2ECOBridge to adjust the multiplier based on the L1 ECO token's past linear inflation multiplier.

However, since new rebasers can be added, there's a possibility that another address might be included as a rebaser. If a different rebaser calls L2ECO.rebase, the linearInflationMultiplier will deviate from L2ECOBridge.inflationMultiplier.

Consequently, deposits and withdrawals passing through L2ECOBridge will have an incorrect multiplier applied to these transfers.

## Impact
Deposits and withdrawals transacted through L2ECOBridge may have an incorrect linear inflation multiplier if a rebaser other than L2ECOBridge directly calls L2ECO.rebase.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure the linearInflationMultiplier value is always consistent across contracts. Instead of maintaining the value in two contracts, consider fetching it from a single contract when needed.

Rather than using an inflationMultiplier parameter on L2ECOBridge, call l2Eco.linearInflationMultiplier() directly.
