# Rebase Cross-Domain Extra Mint

## Summary
Since rebasing is not done atomically, an attacker could exploit a race-condition vulnerability through the difference of `inflationMultiplier` on the different chains to bridge more tokens than expected.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a rebase event happens on the L1 bridge, anyone can call the `rebase` function in order to update the `inflationMultiplier` on both the L1 and L2 bridge. However, this does not happen atomically. There is a time period between the confirmation of the `rebase()` transaction on the L1 bridge and the time the Cross Domain Account (CDA) calls the `rebase()` function on the L2 bridge (~ 15 minutes, which is a reasonable amount of time to attack. [source](https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/bridge/messaging/#communication-speed))

Let's take the following attack scenario:

1. The `inflationMultiplier` has the value of `10` on both L1 and L2 bridge, but the value of what `IECO(l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation` returns becomes `8`.
2. Dev calls rebase on L1 bridge, and the `inflationMultiplier` becomes `8`. The CDA is scheduled to update the `inflationMultiplier` on L2 which is still `10`. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L296-L307
3. Attacker has `1000` L2 tokens which he bridges to L1, before the CDA transaction confirms. The `amount` in the message sent to L1 will be multiplied by `inflationMultiplier` which is stil `10`, so amount will be `10000`. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L2ECOBridge.sol#L239-L240
4. When the message gets to L1, the amount of tokens he receives is divided by the `inflationMultiplier` on L1, which is `8`, so the amount transferred to the attacker is `10000 / 8 = 1250`. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L244

## Impact
As stated in the Q/A, rebase events are infrequent, which is a double-edged sword for this vulnerability: with less rebase events, there is a lower chance of an attack, however, since rebasing is infrequent, the difference between the old and the new `inflationMultiplier` can be bigger (again, L1 rebasing token out-of-scope, team can verify impact).

## Recommendation
Atomicity is obviously not possible cross-chain, but you could send the `inflationMultiplier` value along with each finalization transaction (deposit/withdraw) through the Cross Domain Account in order to make sure the bridge can calculate the correct amount of tokens to send.
