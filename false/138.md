# Accidently setting `linearInflationMultiplier` to 0 in `_rebase` breaks a lot of functionality which could be fatal for the protocol.

## Summary
Accidently setting `linearInflationMultiplier` to 0 in `_rebase` breaks a lot of functionality which could be fatal for the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `tokenRoleAdmin` can call `updateRebasers` to set any other address to `RebaserRole`

The RebaserRole (modifier: onlyRebaserRole) can call `rebase` to set new value (including 0) to `linearInflationMultiplier` which would directly break -

`_beforeTokenTransfer`
`balanceOf`
`totalSupply`

and cause loss of funds in bridging process.

```solidity
function _rebase(uint256 _newLinearInflationMultiplier) internal {
        //!! need upper/lower limit? It could be 0.
        linearInflationMultiplier = _newLinearInflationMultiplier;
    }
```

When this function `rebase()` is called from L2ECO, it is protected by the check
validRebaseMultiplier(_inflationMultiplier) which does not allow 0 amount to be set.


```solidity
l2Eco.rebase(_inflationMultiplier);
```

Checking on root level, the `getPastLinearInflation()` of `IECO` (not in-scope), does return 0 amount in certain case. 

```solidity
inflationMultiplier = IECO(l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(
            block.number
        );
```

The modifier here protects it, but the same is not protected on root level when the new rebaser address assigned by `TokenRoleAdmin` sets 0 amount to `linearInflationMultiplier`.

## Impact
Massive loss of funds on bridging, and broken view/get functions because of 'divide by zero error', which leads to even further problems.

Setting high severity, because even if the chance of this happening is low, it would be critical loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Added greater than 0 `require` check at the root level so this never breaks even on further protocol updates. Be safe than sorry.
