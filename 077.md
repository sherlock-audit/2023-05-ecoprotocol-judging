# inflationMultiplier for L2ECO may vary suddenly for one time and then acts as lagging variable

## Summary
L2ECO's linearInflationMultiplier variable is set to 1e18. This multiplier is used in computing balanceOf. totalSupply and computation of amount in beforeTokenTransfer.
But once the rebase function on L1ECOBridgle is called, the value from L1ECO is fetched and passed to L2ECOBridge and L2ECO as well.

At this point, L2ECO's inflationMultipler will be same as L1ECO at that time. After that it will align every time the rebase is called, which can be called by any one.

## Vulnerability Detail
The initial window before the first rebase call, there is a potential issue where the value of total Supply, balance my be off until the rebase is called.

The L2ECO's inflation multipler is a lagging number which aligns to L1ECO on rebase. since l2ECO does not have a specific logic to update the inflationMultiplier, it would be better to keep the inflation multiplier same between L1ECO and L2ECO by reading dynamically from the previous block as part of deposit and withdrawl transaction and update via crossDomain Message.

Any one making a deposit or withdrawal before the rebase call on L1ECOBridge might have positive and negative impact depending on how fast the inflation has moved.

## Impact
The inflationMultiplier is reliant on rebasers to periodically call rebase function on L1Eco to keep the multiplier upto date. Until then, the valuations could be drifting away impacting how the totalSupply, balance etc are valued.

Especially, the first call is critical for alignment. Also, considering crypto movement being fast paced, I would not assume that inflation will not grow very quickly and hence wont impact valuation in L2ECO

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Automate the syncing mechanism of Inflation Multiplier between L1 and L2.

Define a threshold that should trigger an update of inflationMultipler on L2ECO and L2ECOBridge.

On deposit and withdrawls, develop a logic to compute the variation between previous and current inflationMultiplier. If the variation
between the two is above threshold, update the inflationMultiplier using cross domain message so that valuation in L2ECO are done with respect to current inflation in context.

```solidity
   inflationMultiplier = IECO(l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(
            block.number
        );
```
