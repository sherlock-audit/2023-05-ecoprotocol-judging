# Bridge contracts aren't upgraedable

## Summary
platform admins will not have the possibility to change the main variables of the contract,making it non-upgraedable
## Vulnerability Detail
all the variables inserted and set in the constructor will not be changeable in the future, this is dangerous, given that in case one of the contracts connected to the Bridges is exploited

## Impact
it will make the bridge one (contract)vulnerable and without the possibility of removing the malicious contract by changing it

## Tool used
VSCode

## Recommendation
create one function for each variable setted on initialize() that could be called only by the owner of the contract
