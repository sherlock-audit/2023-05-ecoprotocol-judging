# Return value of ECO.transferFrom not checked

## Summary
In `L1ECOBridge#_initiateERC20Deposit` return value of `IECO(_l1Token).transferFrom()` not checked
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L333
Since it checked in `finalizeERC20Withdrawal()`, i believe it should also be checked consistently to prevent loss of funds
```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory returnData) = _l1Token.call{value: 0}(
    _ecoTransferMessage
);

// make sure that the call to transfer didn't revert or return false
// @audit checked both call didn't reverted and return true 
if (success && abi.decode(returnData, (bool))) {
    // if successful, emit an event
    emit ERC20WithdrawalFinalized(
        _l1Token,
        _l2Token,
        _from,
        _to,
        _amount,
        _data
    );
```

## Vulnerability Detail
See summary

## Impact
Loss of funds for protocol if `transferFrom` silently fail
