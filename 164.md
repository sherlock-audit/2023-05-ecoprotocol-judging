# Storage state of `CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable` is not upgradable

## Summary
`CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable` is the base contract of `L1ECOBridge` and `L2ECOBridge` and since it doesn't have storage gaps, it cannot add/remove storage variables in upgrades.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the developer adds storage variables in `CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable`, it will overwrite storage space of `L1ECOBridge` and `L2ECOBridge`.
If the developer removes, storage space of `L1ECOBridge` and `L2ECOBridge` will overlap `CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable`'s.
This will result in incorrect variable values.

## Impact
Bridge operation might be ceased.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add storage gaps, e.g.
```solidity
    /**
     * @dev This empty reserved space is put in place to allow future versions to add new
     * variables without shifting down storage in the inheritance chain.
     * See https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps
     */
    uint256[45] private __gap;
```
