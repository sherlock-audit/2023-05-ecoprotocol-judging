# The assertion in the onlyEOA() modifier can be bypassed.

## Summary

The `onlyEOA()` modifier check can be bypassed by using contract with constructor only code.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `account.code.length == 0` assertion for checking if an account is EOA is not valid. It can be exploited as shown in here: [Ghost-Contract](https://github.com/0xKitsune/Ghost-Contract)
 
> As demonstrated in this repo, a contract can use the CREATE opcode and execute an arbitrary payload, which can call another contract, transfer tokens or anything else that a normal contract can do. When using this approach to call another contract, because the execution of this logic is within the constructor, the codesize of the msg.sender is 0.

## Impact

It allows contract with constructor only code contract to perform deposits from contracts.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

While based on the developer comments currently it is an acceptable risk, but using `tx.origin == msg.sender` to check whether the `msg.sender` is EOA is recommended to mitigate the risk.
