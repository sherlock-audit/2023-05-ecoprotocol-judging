# Potential Implications of Changing `inflationMultiplier` during L2-to-L1 Bridge Transfers


## Summary

The token transfer doesn't work properly if the rebase function is called during the transfer between L1 and L2.
If the rebase inflation multiplier changes while processing a transfer between an L1 and L2 bridge, it can lead to inconsistencies in the token balances and potentially disrupt the expected behavior of the token supply.

```solidity
File: contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L296-L307
/**
* @inheritdoc IL1ECOBridge
*/
function rebase(uint32 _l2Gas) external {
    inflationMultiplier = IECO(l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(
        block.number
    );

    bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
        IL2ECOBridge.rebase.selector,
        inflationMultiplier
    );

    sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, _l2Gas, message);
}

```solidity
File: contracts/bridge/L2ECOBridge.sol#L229-L240
    function _initiateWithdrawal(
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _l1Gas,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) internal {
        // Burn the withdrawn tokens from L2
        l2Eco.burn(msg.sender, _amount);

        // Construct calldata for l1TokenBridge.finalizeERC20Withdrawal(_to, _amount)
        _amount = _amount * inflationMultiplier;
```

```solidity
File: contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L236-L244
    function finalizeERC20Withdrawal(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _gonsAmount,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external onlyFromCrossDomainAccount(l2TokenBridge) {
        uint256 _amount = _gonsAmount / inflationMultiplier;
```


## Impact

Balance discrepancies: If the inflation multiplier changes while the transfer is being processed, the token balances on the L1 and L2 bridges may become inconsistent. The transferred token amount might not align with the adjusted balances due to the change in the multiplier.

Incorrect supply on L1: If the rebase inflation multiplier changes before the transfer is completed, the token supply on the L1 bridge may be inaccurate. The new multiplier will impact the supply adjustment during future rebases, potentially causing discrepancies between the L1 and L2 token supplies.

## Recommendation

To mitigate these issues, it's crucial to ensure proper synchronization and coordination between the L1 and L2 bridges when processing transfers for rebase tokens. The bridges should take into account any changes in the inflation multiplier and adjust the transferred token amounts and balances accordingly.

We have two options when we modify the inflationMultiplier: either we stop the token transfer temporarily or we retain the old inflationMultiplier and apply it instead of the new one.
