# STOPTHECAP - Rebase can be frontrun on L2 and change users' deposits L2ECO amount based on updated inflationMultiplier

## Summary

Rebase can be frontrun on L2 and change users' deposits of L2ECO amount based on the updated inflationMultiplier.

## Vulnerability Detail

`L1ECOBridge.rebase` is a function designed to update the `linearInflationMultiplier` on `L2ECO` by taking the L1 ECO past linear inflation multiplier and sending a cross-domain message to the `L2ECOBridge` contract. The issue lies in the user-provided `_l2Gas` parameter, which can be used to frontrun deposits on L2 and alter the pending deposits of L2ECO token amounts.

Proof of concept:

1. Alice calls `L1ECOBridge.depositERC20` and makes a deposit of 100 ECO to L2 when the inflation multiplier on L1 is 1e18, implying she should receive 100 L2ECO tokens on Optimism.
2. Alice monitors the blockchain and identifies an inflation multiplier change of the L1 ECO token from 1e18 to 1.05e18.
3. Alice calls `L1ECOBridge.rebase` with a higher `_l2Gas` amount than her initial transaction.
4. Due to the higher L2 gas, the rebase will be applied before her deposit, and she will be awarded 105 L2ECO tokens instead of 100.

## Impact

Users can frontrun deposit transactions in order to receive more L2ECO tokens with a rebase when the L1 inflation multiplier has changed in a way that is beneficial to them.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include the current `linearInflationMultiplier` in the `L1ECOBridge.depositERC20` deposit parameter and decode it on L2 in order to apply the correct inflation multiplier that was active at the time of the deposit.
