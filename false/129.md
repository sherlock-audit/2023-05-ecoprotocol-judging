# Withdrawals with more then 120,000 data length cannot be u-turned.

## Summary

When a user withdraws from L2 the funds are transferred using the ECO token. 
In case of reverts in ECO token, the funds are sent back to L2.
If the user has supplied optional data that is larger then ~120,000 bytes. The transaction will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

There is no limitation to the amount of data supplied when withdrawing through the bridge. 
```solidity 
* @param _data Optional data to forward to L1.
     */
    function _initiateWithdrawal(
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _l1Gas,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) internal {
```

When the message is relayed to the L1Bridge and there is a revert on transfer to ECO (due to pausing, supply, zero address, upgrades, etc..) the funds are sent back through the `L1CrossDomainMessenger`
```solidity
            // if the transfer fails, create a return tx
            bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
                IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector,
                _l1Token,
                _l2Token,
                _to, // switched the _to and _from here to bounce back the deposit to the sender
                _from,
                _gonsAmount,
                _data
            );

            // Send message up to L1 bridge
            sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, 0, message);
```

The L1CrossDomainMessenger sends the message through `OptimismPortal.depositTransaction`

```solidity
    function _sendMessage(
        address _to,
        uint64 _gasLimit,
        uint256 _value,
        bytes memory _data
    ) internal override {
        PORTAL.depositTransaction{ value: _value }(_to, _value, _gasLimit, false, _data);
    }
``` 

in `depositTransaction` there is a check to see if the data is larger then 120,000 which will make the transaction revert
https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/aef727647d293b91e73e4248cae0c297ac492733/packages/contracts-bedrock/contracts/L1/OptimismPortal.sol#LL461C17-L461C22
```solidity
        require(_data.length <= 120_000, "OptimismPortal: data too large");
```

## Impact

Impact is dependent on the reason for the revert. It could be temporary in case its because a "pause" and it could be permanently if the revert is for example because of a failed transfer or transfer to zero address (which is not allowed on L1 but allowed on L2).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the same require statement in L2 bridge to validate that the transaction will be able to u-turn
