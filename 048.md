# Back-running`rebase()` through L2â†’L1 withdrawals could lead to catastrophic `totalSupply` underflow in L1 and L2.

## Summary
Information asymmetry between bridges arises due to the nature of how information is passed between them. This asymmetry allows for a user withdrawing more to L1 than he had when he deposited.

## Vulnerability Detail
Given: 
	- Bob L2 ECO balance: 1
	- `inflationMultiplier`: 0.05 
	- For simplicity lets ignore the following calculation in L1 ECO `_beforeTokenTransfer()`, but keep in mind this multiplication can actually exacerbate the gains from this exploit.
```solidity
uint256 gonsAmount = amount *
_checkpointsLookup(_linearInflationCheckpoints, block.number);
```

1. `rebase()` is called on L1 and updates `inflationMultiplier = 0.03`.

2. Bob performs a L2 -> L1 `_initiateWithdrawal()` call after `rebase()` has updated `inflationMultiplier` in L1,
but before it has been updated in L2.

2a. Because `rebase()` has not updated `infaltionMultiplier` in L2 yet we have:
		  `_amount = 1 * 0.05 = 0.005` in `_initiateWithdrawal()`.

2b. `finalizeERC20Withdrawal()` is called in L1 where `inflationMultiplier` has already been updated.
		We then have (as outlined in step #1):
		`_amount = 0.005 / 0.003 = 1.66` (approximately)

```solidity
		_amount = _gonsAmount / inflationMultiplier;
```

3. Bob has now turned his 1 ECO into 1.66 ECO.

4. Bob bridges back to L2 and awaits for his next opportunity

5. Bob does this many many times growing his balance to insane amounts. 
	Miraculously no one realised so far, because after all no one is really losing money, but this is about to change.

6. Now Bobs balance is even greater than L2 ECO `totalSupply`.

7. Bobs bridges back to L1 and `burn()`s all his L2 tokens, making L2 `totalSupply` overflow.
OBS: Bob could also simply stop all users from bridging back by turning L2 `totalSupply` into zero or near zero instead.

8. Bob keeps doing this until his balance is equal or close to L1 `totalSupply`.
OBS: Bob could also stop after step #7, which would prevent anyone from bridging to L2 due to `totalSupply` minting overflow reverting.

9. Bob burns all his tokens and makes L1 ECO `totalSupply = 0`, completely breaking the token and the bridge.

Note: The scenario described here is the worst case scenario and a lot harder to pull off, it could be that Bob would stop after just getting enough tokens to feed his family instead of breaking L2 or L1 ECO `totalSupply`.  

## Impact
All user funds in L1 and L2 are lost, bridges becomes unusable and token accounting is broken.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There will always be an exploitable delay if L2 `rebase()` is called through the L1 `messenger`.
I recommend making `rebase()` permissioned and pausing L2 withdraws before `rebase()` is called and until both sides of the bridge are properly updated.
