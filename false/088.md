# onlyEOA modifier that ensures call is from EOA might not hold true in the future

## Summary
modifier onlyEOA is used to ensure calls are only made from EOAï¼ŒIf msg.sender is not an externally owned account (EOA) and the attack contract is constructed within the constructor, it can lead to Bypassing the modifier

## Vulnerability Detail
Since the constructor is automatically executed during contract deployment without the need for a function call, the attack contract created within the constructor can bypass the check of the onlyEOA() modifier. This means that the attack contract can make deposits from another contract account, even if it is not an EOA

## Impact
Using modifier onlyEOA to ensure calls are made only from EOA will not hold true

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend using OpenZepellin's isContract function (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/utils#Address-isContract-address-). Note that there are edge cases like contract in constructor that can bypass this and hence caution is required when using this.
