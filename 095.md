# use of unsafeTransfer

## Summary
using unsafetransfer to transfer token from a user.
## Vulnerability Detail
`L1ECOBridge.sol#_initiateERC20Deposit` uses `transferFrom` to transfer token from a user to `L1ECOBridge`, but this could fail silently and would not revert meaning that the `_l1Token` would not be transferred to `L1ECOBridge` contract but the message would still be sent to the `l2TokenBridge` even if the `_l1token` was not transferred from the user.
## Impact
Transfers may fail silently on `L1ECOBridge` but token would still be minted on `L2ECOBridge`.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
IECO(_l1Token).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `safetransferFrom` from `safeERC20` library from openzepplin.
