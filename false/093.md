# Precision loss issue in `balanceOf` function with integer division

## Summary
If the value of `super.balanceOf()` is smaller than `linearInflationMultiplier`, the return value will be truncated to 0.

## Vulnerability Detail
As the code below,`super.balanceOf()` retrieves the balance of address `_owner` from the parent contract. Then, it divides the balance by `linearInflationMultiplier` to adjust the precision. However, if the balance  is smaller than linearInflationMultiplier, the result of the integer division will be less than 1 and truncated to 0.
```solidity
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view override returns (uint256) {
        return super.balanceOf(_owner) / linearInflationMultiplier;
    }

```
## Impact
This can lead to inaccurate return results as the actual balance value is discarded. When using this code, it is important to ensure that the value of linearInflationMultiplier is not greater than the balance in the parent contract to avoid precision loss issues. If linearInflationMultiplier could be larger than the parent contract's balance, alternative approaches should be considered to handle precision, such as using floating-point arithmetic or more precise mathematical libraries.
