# User might not be able to transfer back to L1 due to `inflationMultiplier` increase.

## Summary
L2 `inflationMultiplier` might break `accountBalance >= gonsAmount` check.
## Vulnerability Detail

If `rebase()` increases the L2 `inflationMultiplier` users will not be able to bridge all their tokens back to L1, because old `accountBalance` will not be as high as `gonsAmount` which takes the new and higher value of `inflationMultiplier` into account.

## Impact
Users can't fully bridge their tokens back to L1.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the new `inflationMultiplier` in L2 when comparing `accountBalance` to `gonsAmount` in the L2ECO `_burn()` function.
