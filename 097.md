# Contracts can not be initialized

## Summary
Contracts can not be initialized because of the wrong usage of ```_disableInitializers()``` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
```_disableInitializers()``` function is created for safety to prevent someone else from initializing your "implementation" contract especially for "UUPS" contracts. On the other hand, in "TransparentProxy" contracts since "proxy" and "implementation" contracts are same and just differ in their allowance (only Proxyadmin can use the proxy functions and users can interact with main functions) implementing ```_disableInitializers``` can cause unwanted results and in the contracts that are in scope; it cause.
Let's look at the [L1EcoBridge](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L26) and [L2EcoBridge](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L2ECOBridge.sol#L27) contracts first. These contracts inherit from ```CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable``` as shown:

```solidity
contract L1ECOBridge is IL1ECOBridge, CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable {
```
```solidity
contract L2ECOBridge is IL2ECOBridge, CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable {
```
and ```CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable``` contract [has](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable.sol#L43-L45):
```solidity
 constructor() {
        _disableInitializers();
    }
```
Let's now check [L2Eco.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/token/L2ECO.sol#L137-L139)
```solidity
constructor() {
        _disableInitializers();
    }
```
as can be seen, all these 3 contracts have constructors with ```_disableInitializers()``` functions. What this functions does can be seen from [Initializable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/25aabd286e002a1526c345c8db259d57bdf0ad28/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol#L137-L150)
```solidity
 /**
     * @dev Locks the contract, preventing any future reinitialization. This cannot be part of an initializer call.
     * Calling this in the constructor of a contract will prevent that contract from being initialized or reinitialized
     * to any version. It is recommended to use this to lock implementation contracts that are designed to be called
     * through proxies.
     *
     * Emits an {Initialized} event the first time it is successfully executed.
     */
    function _disableInitializers() internal virtual {
        require(!_initializing, "Initializable: contract is initializing");
        if (_initialized != type(uint8).max) {
            _initialized = type(uint8).max;
            emit Initialized(type(uint8).max);
        }
    }
```
It makes ```_initialized = type(uint8).max``` in order to prevent any further initialization. This is done in order to lock "implementation" contract which won't be initialized and just will be called through proxies once in their lifetime. Since our contracts are proxy contracts itselves, in the current implementation, contracts can not be initialized ever.
## Impact
Contract's can not be initialized hence can not be used.

## Recommendation
Don't use ```_disableInitializers()``` in constructors.
