# User might mint Tokens without depositing - Inconsistent assumptions for return value of transfer/transferfrom

## Summary

The contract takes some assumptions about calling transfer/transferFrom, as it is intended to always be used with the ECO token.
However, this assumptions are not consistent throughout the code, which enables us to assume, that the behaviour might change in future and a check for the return value of `transfer`/`transferFrom` is necessary to ensure a succesful transfer.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are multiple places where `transfer`/`transferFrom` is called in the contracts. Sometimes the contract checks for the return value, sometimes not.
in `_initiateERC20Deposit` in L1ECOBridge `transferFrom` is called without checking for any return value. It is assumed, that the transfer was successfull if it did not revert.
However in the same contract in `finalizeERC20Withdrawal` there is an encoded call to `transfer`, and afterwards there is a check if the Transaction reverted **AND** did return `true`. 
Right now the ECO token should always revert on failed transfers, but as it is an upgradable Token, this might change in future. The Token does indeed return true on successful transfers. 
As there is a check for the return value in another function we are to assume that this might be/become a necessary check to do. Therefore we can assume, that there is a possibility for the unchecked `transferFrom` in `_initiateERC20Deposit` top silently fail.
If this is the case, an attacker could force it to silently fail and be able to mint Tokens on L2 without actually depositing on L1, as the `_initiateERC20Deposit` goes on to send a Corsschainmessage and call `finalizeDeposit` on L2ECOBridge which is going to mint tokens to our address.

## Impact

If the first Token transfer would silently fail, because there was a missing check for the return, a user might gain Tokens on. L2, without depositing on L1.

## Recommendation

Check for return value of `transferFrom` in `_initiateERC20Deposit` of L1ECOBridge.
