# Unrestricted Zero-Value Withdrawals in Layer 2 to Layer 1 Bridge Contract

## Summary

The smart contract allows for Layer 2 to Layer 1 withdrawal transactions of 0 value. This could be potentially exploited by an attacker to congest the L2 to L1 bridge with unnecessary transactions, potentially causing a slowdown in legitimate, non-zero-value transfers.

## Vulnerability Detail

Withdraw and withdrawTo functions from L2EcoBridge.sol do not prevent a withdrawal amount of 0. This opens up a potential attack vector where an attacker could call these functions multiple times with a 0-value transfer. Given that Layer 2 to Layer 1 communication can be limited and slower due to the security mechanisms involved, this could congest the bridge with unnecessary transactions, potentially causing a slowdown or delay in processing of legitimate transfers.

## Impact

This could lead to degradation in the performance of the L2 to L1 bridge, causing slower processing times for legitimate transfers. In extreme cases, it may lead to a temporary Denial of Service (DoS) condition if the system is overwhelmed with 0-value transfer requests.

```solidity
function withdraw(
        address _l2Token,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _l1Gas,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external virtual isL2EcoToken(_l2Token) {
        _initiateWithdrawal(msg.sender, msg.sender, _amount, _l1Gas, _data);
    }

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a require statement
`require(_amount` > 0, "Withdrawal amount must be greater than `zero")` By doing this, any attempts to initiate a 0-value transfer would fail, and thus would not be able to be used to congest the network.
