# STOPTHECAP - L2ECO linearInflationMultiplier gets initialized to L1's INITIAL_INFLATION_MULTIPLIER, which is not necessarily the current inflation multiplier, allowing users to hypothetically bridge and frontrun a rebase in order to gain more L2 tokens

## Summary
The linearInflationMultiplier in L2ECO is initialized to the INITIAL_INFLATION_MULTIPLIER of L1 ECO, which may not necessarily reflect the current inflation multiplier on L1.

## Vulnerability Detail
The L2ECO initializer sets linearInflationMultiplier to INITIAL_INFLATION_MULTIPLIER. This is the same default value as the L1 ECO token: https://etherscan.io/address/0x8dBF9A4c99580fC7Fd4024ee08f3994420035727

However, since ECO is a rebasing token, this initial value may not necessarily correspond to the current inflation multiplier, which can be computed through IECO(l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(block.number).

This indicates that the L2ECO initial value will always have an inflation multiplier which is less than or equal to L1's inflation multiplier.

If the L1 inflation multiplier is greater than its default value, users who bridge to L2 before a L2ECO.rebase is called will receive fewer tokens than they should.


## Impact
Users who bridge to L2 before a L2ECO.rebase is called will receive fewer tokens than they should if the L1 ECO inflation multiplier is different from its default value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a _linearInflationMultiplier function parameter to L2ECO.initialize so that a deployment script can correctly fetch L1's current inflation multiplier and set the default value of the L2ECO token.
