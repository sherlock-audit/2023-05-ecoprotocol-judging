# No check if eco token supports mint and burn functions in bridge contracts leads to users' funds stuck in bridge

## Summary
Both L1ECO and L2ECO are upgradeable proxies. Developers can make a mistake in future versions, missing implementation of `mint()` and `burn()`. Which results in stuck of users' tokens in bridge contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
Suppose new version of ECO is released, L1 and L2 tokens are upgraded, but there is no `mint()` and `burn()` function.

1) In case of L2ECO there is problem when in L1 user deposited (sent tokens to L1Bridge), but in `L2Bridge#finalizeDeposit()` method mint fails. Resulting in lost of L1 users' funds.
```solidity
    function finalizeDeposit(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        bytes calldata _data
    )
        external
        virtual
        onlyFromCrossDomainAccount(l1TokenBridge)
        isL1EcoToken(_l1Token)
        isL2EcoToken(_l2Token)
    {
        // When a deposit is finalized, we convert the transferred gons to ECO using the current
        // inflation multiplier, then we credit the account on L2 with the same amount of tokens.
        _amount = _amount / inflationMultiplier;
        L2ECO(_l2Token).mint(_to, _amount); //@audit add check supports interface
        emit DepositFinalized(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);
    }
```
2) Or user withdraws from L2, but token transfer fails in L1ECOBridge. So `L2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit()` flow is executed - again there is problem if L2ECO supports burn, but doesn't support mint.
```solidity
        // make sure that the call to transfer didn't revert or return false
        if (success && abi.decode(returnData, (bool))) {
            // if successful, emit an event
            ...
        } else {
            // if the transfer fails, create a return tx
            bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
                IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector,
                _l1Token,
                _l2Token,
                _to, // switched the _to and _from here to bounce back the deposit to the sender
                _from,
                _gonsAmount,
                _data
            );

            // Send message up to L1 bridge

            sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, 0, message);
```

## Impact
Users lose tokens while use bridging feature

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add sanity check of `supportsInterface()` before calling ECO mint() and burn()
