# updateTokenRoleAdmin() should be two step update process

## Summary
updateTokenRoleAdmin() is used to update new admin but it should be two step process for updating to new admin.

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In L2ECO.sol, updateTokenRoleAdmin() function is given as below,

```solidity
File: contracts/token/L2ECO.sol

220    function updateTokenRoleAdmin(address _newAdmin) public onlyTokenRoleAdmin {
221        tokenRoleAdmin = _newAdmin;
222    }
```

As seen above, the function just take the new admin address and update it directly without any acceptance/verification from the new admin. This critical address transfer in one-step  update/transfer of new admin address which is very risky as it is irrecoverable from any mistakes. In addition, the function does  not even check the address(0) validation. 

If an incorrect address, e.g. for which the private key is not known, is used accidentally then it prevents the use of all the onlyTokenRoleAdmin modifier accessed functions forever, which includes the changing/setting of various critical functions as below,

1)updateMinters( ) function,
2)updateBurners( ) function,
3)updateRebasers( ) function,
4)updateTokenRoleAdmin( ) function.

This use of incorrect address may not even be immediately apparent given that these functions are probably not used immediately. When noticed, due to a failing onlyTokenRoleAdmin function call, it will force the redeployment of the L2ECO.sol contract and require appropriate changes and notifications for switching from the old to new address. This will diminish trust in markets and can incur a significant reputational damage.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

1)Use a two-step address change to new admin address separately using setter functions:

Step 1) Approve a new address as a pendingAdmin
Step 2) A transaction from the pendingAdmin (newAdmin) address claims the pending admin change.

This mitigates risk because if an incorrect address is used in step -(1) then it can be fixed by re-approving the correct address. Only after a correct address is used in step -(1) can step -(2) happen and complete the address change.

2)Another recommended alternative is to use Openzeppelin Ownable2Step.sol. Ownable2Step is safer than Ownable for smart contracts because the owner cannot accidentally transfer smart contract ownership to a non-existent address. Rather than directly transferring to the new owner, the transfer only completes when the new owner accepts ownership.

Here are the docs and the code reference links,
[Ownable2Step docs](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/access#Ownable2Step)
[Ownable2Step code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelincontracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol)

3)Consider adding a time-delay for such sensitive actions. And at a minimum, use a multisig owner address and not an EOA.

4)Consider implementing zero address check.

5)Also emit events while changing address state variables
