# Wrong amount can be deposited to L2 if cross domain messager reorder transaction

## Summary
Wrong amount can be deposited to L2 if cross domain messager reorder messages

## Vulnerability Detail
To deposit tokens to L2 chain `_amount` first multiplied by `inflationMultiplier` (L1 value) in `L1ECOBridge#_initiateERC20Deposit`, then divided by `inflationMultiplier` (L2 value) in `L2ECOBridge#finalizeDeposit`. If L1 value != L2 value, wrong amount will be deposited. 
If cross domain messanger will reorder messages and `finalizeDeposit` come first, and then `L2ECOBridge#rebase` resulting in different `inflationMultiplier` on L1 and L2
This is possible because there is no guarantee of cross domain message ordering

## Impact
Wrong amount can be deposited to L2 if cross domain messager reorder transaction

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rebases are infrequent and possible solution would be to pause dipositing until `inflationMultiplier` updated in each chain
