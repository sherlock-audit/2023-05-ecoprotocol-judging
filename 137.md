# Pause incompatibility between L1 and L2 Eco

## Summary
Incompatibility issues with L2 Eco when mainnet Eco is paused

## Vulnerability Detail
[L2ECO.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/token/L2ECO.sol) doesn't have pause functionality, while ECO on L1 [has](https://github.com/helix-foundation/currency/blob/master/contracts/currency/ERC20Pausable.sol#L68). This incompatibility can lead to some problems.

One example is in case of a hack on L1 Eco -> L1 Eco gets paused, but the attacker could still manipulate price via burning their own tokens with the [L2ECO.sol - burn()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/token/L2ECO.sol#L239-L245) function ([onlyBurnerRoleOrSelf()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/token/L2ECO.sol#L106-L112)) which drives up the price of Eco on L2. For example if L2 ECO is used as collateral in another protocol this would boost up their collateral's value which could lead to a potential exploit on that protocol. Other potential issues are possible.

Note: I thought about whether to include this as a vulnerability or not but I decided to submit it as it can have potentially big consequences.

## Impact
Price manipulation and other issues with L2 Eco when mainnet Eco is paused

## Code Snippet
[ECO - ERC20Pausable.sol - pause()](https://github.com/helix-foundation/currency/blob/master/contracts/currency/ERC20Pausable.sol#L68)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add pause functionality to `L2ECO.sol` and a pauser role. Enforce the pause is synchronized between L1 ECO and `L2ECO.sol`.
