# `inflationMultiplier` misconfiguration after initializing contracts

## Summary
Current implementation of `initialize()` in L1ECOBridge.sol allows `inflationMultiplier` to differ from value stored in L2ECOBridge.sol

## Vulnerability Detail
In L1ECOBridge initialized value is taken from ECO token on L1:
```solidity
    function initialize(
        address _l1messenger,
        address _l2TokenBridge,
        address _l1Eco,
        address _l2Eco,
        address _l1ProxyAdmin,
        address _upgrader
    ) public initializer {
       ...

        inflationMultiplier = IECO(_l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(
            block.number
        );
    }
```

But at the same time in L2ECOBridge `inflationMultiplier` is set to 1e18:
```solidity
    function initialize(
        address _l2CrossDomainMessenger,
        address _l1TokenBridge,
        address _l1Eco,
        address _l2Eco,
        address _l2ProxyAdmin
    ) public initializer {
        ...

        inflationMultiplier = l2Eco.INITIAL_INFLATION_MULTIPLIER();
    }
```
So current contract setup allows existing a gap when `inflationMultiplier` is different on L1 and L2 bridges.
In protocol readme on Sherlock is stated that deployer is trusted during deploy, i.e. after deploy he is not trusted anymore
However arbitrary user can perform following attack vector:
1. Deployer deploys contracts
2. Malicious user bridges assets from L1 to L2.
3. Benefits from bridging to L2 because `inflationMultiplier` on L1 is higher than on L2 (> 1e18).
4. User calls `L1ECOBridge.rebase()` to take profit and prevent other users from abusing.

## Impact
Arbitrary amount of L2ECO can be minted. The only condition is to have `inflationMultiplier` value on L1 be higher than 1e18 after deploy, which looks very likely.

Also want to mention that Sherlock has marked misconfiguration issues as valid even though the owner is trusted. Like it was [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-nftport-judging/issues/83)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend you to send cross domain message at the time you set `inflationMultiplier`
For example call `rebase()` instead of just setting value:
```solidity
    function initialize(
        address _l2CrossDomainMessenger,
        address _l1TokenBridge,
        address _l1Eco,
        address _l2Eco,
        address _l2ProxyAdmin
    ) public initializer {
        CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable.__CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable_init(
            _l2CrossDomainMessenger
        );
        l1TokenBridge = _l1TokenBridge;
        l1Eco = _l1Eco;
        l2Eco = L2ECO(_l2Eco);
        l2ProxyAdmin = ProxyAdmin(_l2ProxyAdmin);
        //SOLUTION
        rebase(L2GasArgument);
    }
```
