# Funds will stuck in L2ECOBridge when L1ECO is paused

## Summary
In Optimism transaction from L2 to L1 takes about 1 week. During this one week, the ECO on L1 can be paused, therefore transfer to recipient will fail. To handle this case there exists emergency flow to execute `L2EcoBridge#finalizeDeposit()` to recover burned L2ECO tokens.
But the point is that call to L2ECOBridge has gasLimit = 0.

## Vulnerability Detail
The flow for bridging L2 to L1 is following:
1. `L2ECOBridge#withdraw()` burns user's L2 tokens and call `L1ECOBridge#finalizeERC20Withdrawal()`
```solidity
    function _initiateWithdrawal(
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _l1Gas,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) internal {
        // Burn the withdrawn tokens from L2
        l2Eco.burn(msg.sender, _amount);

        // Construct calldata for l1TokenBridge.finalizeERC20Withdrawal(_to, _amount)
        _amount = _amount * inflationMultiplier;
        bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            //call parent interface of IL1ECOBridge to get the selector
            IL1ERC20Bridge.finalizeERC20Withdrawal.selector,
            l1Eco,
            l2Eco,
            _from,
            _to,
            _amount,
            _data
        );
```
2. If token transfer from L1Bridge to user failed - call `L2ECOBridge#finalizeDeposit()` to recover user's funds
```solidity
            // if the transfer fails, create a return tx
            bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
                IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector,
                _l1Token,
                _l2Token,
                _to, // switched the _to and _from here to bounce back the deposit to the sender
                _from,
                _gonsAmount,
                _data
            );

            // Send message up to L1 bridge
            sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, 0, message);
            // Emit an event to signal success event listeners to expect failure
```
3. As you can see specified gasLimit is 0. Therefore call will fail and user can't recover burned funds.

## Impact
User will lose funds while bridging in case of L2ECO paused
