# `sendCrossDomainMessage` with `0` gas limit fails on L1Bridge

## Summary
`sendCrossDomainMessage` in `L1ECOBridge.finalizeERC20Withdrawal()` with `0` gas limit will always revert 
## Vulnerability Detail
High severity 
## Impact
In case that the ECO contract is paused or a token transfer transaction fails, users which try to withdraw funds from the L2 will not be reimbursed.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L280

## POC
In `sendCrossDomainMessage()`, `L1CrossDomainManager` makes a call to the `CanonicalTransactionChain.enqueue() ` function
https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/e0c4348a6a90612362434a0022c1d37aa2e41b82/packages/contracts/contracts/L1/messaging/L1CrossDomainMessenger.sol#LL371C64-L371C71

Inside this function, a check is made that `_gasLimit` is bigger than a minimum amount which will cause the transaction to revert. Therefore preventing any users from being able to receive their refunds.

Such a check is not made on the L2CrossDomainManager and so is only a bug on L1, not on L2.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace
```solidity
sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, 0, message);
```
with
```solidity
sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, _gasLimit , message);
```
where `_gasLimit` can be defined previously
