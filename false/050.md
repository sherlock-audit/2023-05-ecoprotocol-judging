# 1-step ownership transfer in insecure

## Summary

For the `tokenRoleAdmin` in `ECOL2`, it uses 1-step ownership transfer, which is insecure.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ownership transfer function :
```solidity
function updateTokenRoleAdmin(address _newAdmin) public onlyTokenRoleAdmin {
        tokenRoleAdmin = _newAdmin;
    }
```
simply assign the argument value to the admin without any check.

## Impact

If the `_newAdmin` get typed wrong, the `tokenRoleAdmin` is locked permanently, and no one can change the minter/rebaser/burner roles forever, except for upgrade the contract.
