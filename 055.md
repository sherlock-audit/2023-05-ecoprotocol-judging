# Frontrunning issue with rebase on Layer2 after Bedrock upgrade

## Summary
Different to old Optimism, Bedrock introduces a mempool. Even if this mempool is private, it introduces the concept of transactions with higher gas fee will be executed first. (or are more likely to be included in a future block)
This opens up the possibility of frontrunning.

The rebase mechanism of ECO, can be called by anyone on layer1 and forwards a new inflationMultiplier to the bridge on layer2.
After the Bedrock upgrade, following attack should be possible:
1. Start deposit on layer1, use normal layer1 gas, and a smaller amount of layer2 gas. Now the amount send is calculated with current inflationMultiplier
2. Start the rebase on layer1, use normal layer1 gas (or a bit more to front run other calls of this function) and a lot of layer2 gas.
3. On layer 2, the rebase transaction should execute first, because it has higher gas. This will change the inflationMultiplier
4. After the rebase, the deposit function should finalize and calculate the mint amount with the new inflationMultiplier
This will result in the user minting more tokens then he should have.

## Vulnerability Detail

Start deposit on layer 1 with 100 tokens, the inflationMultiplier is 10
Inside _initiateERC20Deposit() of L1ECOBridge.sol: 
```solidity
 IECO(_l1Token).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);
        // gons move across the bridge, with inflation multipliers on either side to correctly scale balances
        _amount = _amount * inflationMultiplier;

        // Construct calldata for _l2Token.finalizeDeposit(_to, _amount)
        bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            //call parent interface IL2ERC20Bridge to get the selector
            IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector,
            _l1Token,
            _l2Token,
            _from,
            _to,
            _amount,
            _data
        );
```
the send _amount will be 100 * 10 = 1000

Now governance has decided to change the inflationMultiplier to 9. We call rebase with high gas on both layers.
On Layer2 the inflationMultiplier  will be updated to 9.
Now because of low gas, the finalizeDeposit is called:
```solidity
// When a deposit is finalized, we convert the transferred gons to ECO using the current
        // inflation multiplier, then we credit the account on L2 with the same amount of tokens.
        _amount = _amount / inflationMultiplier;
        L2ECO(_l2Token).mint(_to, _amount);
        emit DepositFinalized(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);
```
It now mints new tokens using the new inflationMultiplier, in our case 9.
this means the user gets 111 tokens (1000/9).

He deposited 100 tokens on layer1 and got 111 tokens on layer2.

## Impact
Mint more tokens then allowed, loss of funds for other users when withdrawal back to layer1.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider sending the inflationMultiplier with the transaction from layer1 to layer2.
