# Unhandled Transaction Failure in Cross-Domain Messaging

## Summary
The Layer 1 to Layer 2 and Layer 2 to Layer 1 transfer functions do not handle potential failures of the sendCrossDomainMessage function. If this function can fail without reverting the transaction, tokens could be stuck or burned without the corresponding actions being successfully completed on the other chain.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `_initiateERC20Deposit` from L1EcoBridge.sol and `_initiateWithdrawal` from L2EcoBridge.sol, the `sendCrossDomainMessage()` function is used to send a message across chains, but the potential failure of this function is not explicitly handled. If this function can fail without reverting the transaction, this can lead to funds being locked in the contract on the originating chain without the corresponding actions being completed on the destination chain. This can result in a loss of funds for the user.

## Impact

As the funds are either transferredFrom on L1EcoBridge.sol and burned on L2EcoBridge.sol users could lose funds by either depositing tokens on Layer 1 without those tokens getting minted on Layer 2, or by burning tokens on Layer 2 without those tokens getting transferred on Layer 1.

        IECO(_l1Token).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);
        ...
        // Send calldata into L2
        sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, _l2Gas, message);

        ...
    }
```
```solidity
    function _initiateWithdrawal( address _from,address _to, uint256 _amount, uint32 _l1Gas, bytes calldata _data
    ) internal {
        // Burn the withdrawn tokens from L2
        l2Eco.burn(msg.sender, _amount);
        ....
        // Send message up to L1 bridge
        sendCrossDomainMessage(l1TokenBridge, _l1Gas, message);
        ...
    }
```

## Recommendation

Implement some mechanism to handle errors from cross domain message sent, like boolean or reception callback and document the behavior it could have
