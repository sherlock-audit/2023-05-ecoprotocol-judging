# Lack of Upgrade Mechanism for l1TokenBridge Address

## Summary
The smart contract does not provide a mechanism to upgrade or change the l1TokenBridge address. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `l1TokenBridge` address is initialized once and never updated in the L2ECOBridge.sol. The address is utilized to control the execution of critical functions including `upgradeECO`, `upgradeSelf` and `finalizeDeposit`, which all have the `onlyFromCrossDomainAccount(l1TokenBridge)` modifier applied, meaning they can only be called from the l1TokenBridge address.

This poses a potential risk if the owner of the l1TokenBridge address loses control of it or if there is a need to upgrade or change the l1TokenBridge contract for any reason (e.g., upgrade to the contract, detected vulnerabilities). As it stands, there is no way to update this address to a new one, causing potential permanent loss of control over these functions.

## Impact

This vulnerability can lead to severe impacts:

**Loss of Control:** The contract owner might lose control over critical functions if the l1TokenBridge address is compromised or lost.
**Inflexibility:** The contract cannot respond to changes in the l1TokenBridge contract, limiting its flexibility and adaptability.
**Potential lock of funds:** Users' assets could become inaccessible if control of the L1 bridge is lost and no upgrades or changes can be enacted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement an upgrade function for this variable, either on L2ECOBridge.sol or in CrossDomainEnabledUpgradeable.sol
