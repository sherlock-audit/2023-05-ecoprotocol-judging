# When the inflationMultiplier of *L1ECOBridge* and *L2ECOBridge are inconsistent, it will cause system confusion*

## Summary
When the inflationMultiplier of *L1ECOBridge* and *L2ECOBridge are inconsistent, it will cause system confusion*
## Vulnerability Detail
When the `_initiateERC20Deposit` function of L1 is called, the `_amount` will be processed

```solidity
_amount = _amount * inflationMultiplier;
```

And call L2's `finalizeDeposit` to accept the processed `_amount`,

```solidity
_amount = _amount / inflationMultiplier;
```

However, if the `inflationMultiplier` of L1 is inconsistent with the `inflationMultiplier` of L2, the `amount` deposited by the user through L1 and the `amount` calculated by L2 will be inconsistent, causing system confusion.
## Impact
When the inflationMultiplier of *L1ECOBridge* and *L2ECOBridge* are inconsistent, it will cause system confusion



L2::_initiateWithdrawal and L1::finalizeERC20Withdrawal are the same
