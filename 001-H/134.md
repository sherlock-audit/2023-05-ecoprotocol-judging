# Potential Inflation Adjustment Imbalance in Cross-Chain Withdrawals and Deposits

## Summary
The contracts L1ECOBridge and L2ECOBridge are designed to allow users to initiate withdrawals and deposits between Layer 1 (L1) and Layer 2 (L2) networks. However, due to the asynchronicity inherent in cross-chain interactions and the potential for updates to the inflationMultiplier via the rebase function, an imbalance could arise when a withdrawal is initiated but fails, resulting in a diminished refund to the user.

## Vulnerability Detail
The finalizeERC20Withdrawal() function in the L1ECOBridge contract has a fallback mechanism that initiates a deposit back to the user on L2 when a withdrawal fails. 

In this scenario, a withdrawal request is initiated on L2, but before it's finalized on L1, the rebase() function is called on L1, resulting in an updated inflationMultiplier. 

However, the amount of tokens minted in the finalizeDeposit() function is calculated using the updated inflationMultiplier (literally inflated in this case), potentially leading to a smaller amount being minted than the amount that was initially burned when the withdrawal was initiated.

## Impact
A user initiating a withdrawal could potentially receive a smaller refund if the withdrawal fails due to an increase in inflationMultiplier during the transaction's processing. The impact could be significant even if the delta of inflationMultiplier is small when involving a large burning/minting.

## Code Snippet
In L1ECOBridge:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L267-L290

```solidity
        } else {
            // if the transfer fails, create a return tx
            bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
                IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector,
                _l1Token,
                _l2Token,
                _to, // switched the _to and _from here to bounce back the deposit to the sender
                _from,
                _gonsAmount,
                _data
            );

            // Send message up to L1 bridge
            sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, 0, message);
            // Emit an event to signal success event listeners to expect failure
            emit WithdrawalFailed(
                _l1Token,
                _l2Token,
                _from,
                _to,
                _amount,
                _data
            );
        }
```
In L2ECOBridge:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L2ECOBridge.sol#L159-L164

```solidity
        // When a deposit is finalized, we convert the transferred gons to ECO using the current
        // inflation multiplier, then we credit the account on L2 with the same amount of tokens.
        _amount = _amount / inflationMultiplier;
        L2ECO(_l2Token).mint(_to, _amount);
        emit DepositFinalized(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing mechanisms to handle the case where a withdrawal fails due to an updated inflationMultiplier. This could include refunding the exact amount that was initially withdrawn back to the user on L2. Such a solution would require managing state across both layers and accounting for the time delays inherent in cross-chain communication. Also, consider imposing some restrictions or additional checks around the rebase function to prevent potential exploitation of the system.
