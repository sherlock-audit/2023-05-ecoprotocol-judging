# The mint function doesn't work

## Summary
The mint function in L2ECO can't mint and not even callable by the minter role addresses.

## Vulnerability Detail
The mint function in L2ECO.sol doesn't work because of the onlyMinterRole modifier. This is because "minters" in the  onlyMinterRole modifier is set to false by default.

With the onlyMinterRole modifier, an address must be false to pass the check. What this means is that no address can pass the check so far minters remain false in the mapping. 

## Impact
Regarding the mint function having the onlyMinterRole modifier, what this means is that no address can mint - even not callable by the minter role addresses. 

## Code Snippet

[ function mint(address _to, uint256 _amount) external onlyMinterRole {
        _mint(_to, _amount);
        emit Mint(_to, _amount);
    }](https://github.com/eco-association/op-eco/blob/39f205fb46eea3df770f0119a890ffdc1ac8f382/contracts/token/L2ECO.sol#L229)

[ /**

[modifier onlyMinterRole() {
        require(minters[msg.sender], "L2ECO: not authorized to mint");
        _;
    }
](https://github.com/eco-association/op-eco/blob/39f205fb46eea3df770f0119a890ffdc1ac8f382/contracts/token/L2ECO.sol#L96)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, implement a mechanism to grant minting permissions to specific addresses before using the onlyMinterRole modifier. You can do this by writing a function to allow a designated authority to set the minters mapping to true for specific addresses.
