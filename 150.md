# Stealing funds from users

## Summary
The `ERC20Upgradeable.transferFrom()` function in the protocol allows a spender to transfer tokens from an owner's address to another address. However, there is an inconsistency in the scaling of the transfer amount and the allowance deduction, which can lead to a potential vulnerability.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `transferFrom()` function allows the spender to transfer tokens from the `from` address to the `to` address. However, there is a discrepancy in the scaling of the amount parameter between the `transferFrom()` function and the internal _transfer function.
```solidity
   function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) public virtual override returns (bool) {
        address spender = _msgSender();
        _spendAllowance(from, spender, amount);
        _transfer(from, to, amount);
        return true;
    }
```

In the `transferFrom()` function, the amount parameter is not multiplied by the scaling factor (e.g., 1e18) to account for the token's decimal places. On the other hand, in the internal `_transfer()` function, the amount parameter is multiplied by `linearInflationMultiplier`, which is set to 1e18 in this case.
```solidity
function _transfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal virtual {
        require(from != address(0), "ERC20: transfer from the zero address");
        require(to != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");

        uint256 gonsAmount = _beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);

        uint256 fromBalance = _balances[from];
        require(fromBalance >= gonsAmount, "ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance");
        unchecked {
            _balances[from] = fromBalance - gonsAmount;
            // Overflow not possible: the sum of all balances is capped by totalSupply, and the sum is preserved by
            // decrementing then incrementing.
            _balances[to] += gonsAmount;
        }

        emit Transfer(from, to, amount);

        _afterTokenTransfer(from, to, gonsAmount);
    }

```

As a result, when a large amount of tokens is transferred using transferFrom, the corresponding allowance deducted in the `_spendAllowance()` function is significantly smaller compared to the actual transferred amount. This discrepancy arises because the allowance was approved with the assumption that the amount parameter would be in the unscaled form, while the `_transfer()` function expects the scaled amount value.


## Impact
This discrepancy can lead to a situation where the spender still has a considerable remaining allowance, allowing them to transfer a large number of tokens using a relatively small remaining allowance. This behavior can enable the spender to transfer a substantial amount of tokens from the `from` address without requiring a proportionally significant allowance.

```solidity
 _approve(owner, spender, currentAllowance - amount*linearInflationMultiplier);
```
