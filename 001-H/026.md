# After L1 ECO token inflation but before a rebase, gons are incorrectly calculated when initiating deposits and finalizing withdrawals

## Summary

If a deposit is initiated or a withdrawal finalized in the time between when the L1 token is inflated and the rebase is called on the L1 bridge, then incorrect amounts will be sent as a result of mismatched inflation rates.

## Vulnerability Detail

As the protocol is currently implemented, an inflation event occurs in two steps. 
- First, the L1 ECO token's linear inflation rate is updated
- Then, `rebase()` is called on the L1 bridge, which updates it's inflation multiplier and sends the message to also update the L2 bridge and token

However, there is an issue that can happen between the two steps. 

Let's walk through an example scenario where initially the inflation multiplier across all contracts is `x`.

Then, the L1 tokens inflation multiplier is updated to `y`. Now, if someone initiates a deposit for `amount`, the L1 token will transfer `amount * y` gons to the bridge. 

However, the bridge will still be using the old inflation multiplier `x` to calculate the amount of gons to mint on L2. This means that the L2 bridge will mint `amount * x` gons, which is incorrect.

```solidity
    function _initiateERC20Deposit(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        address _from,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _l2Gas,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) internal {
        // When a deposit is initiated on L1, the L1 Bridge transfers the funds to itself for future
        // withdrawals.

        IECO(_l1Token).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);
        // gons move across the bridge, with inflation multipliers on either side to correctly scale balances
        _amount = _amount * inflationMultiplier;

        // Construct calldata for _l2Token.finalizeDeposit(_to, _amount)
        bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            //call parent interface IL2ERC20Bridge to get the selector
            IL2ERC20Bridge.finalizeDeposit.selector,
            _l1Token,
            _l2Token,
            _from,
            _to,
            _amount,
            _data
        );

        // Send calldata into L2
        sendCrossDomainMessage(l2TokenBridge, _l2Gas, message);

        emit ERC20DepositInitiated(_l1Token, _l2Token, _from, _to, _amount, _data);
    }
```

## Impact

A malicious user could intentionally frontrun the call to `rebase()` using this opportunity to take advantage of the mismatched inflation rates. Receiving more gons than they should.

In other scenarios, this would result in a loss of value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

One solution would be to always refer to the L1 tokens inflation rate directly when initiating a deposit or finalizing a withdrawal. This would ensure that the same rate is used for the token transfer and the internal gons calculation.

For example...

```diff
        IECO(_l1Token).transferFrom(_from, address(this), _amount);
        // gons move across the bridge, with inflation multipliers on either side to correctly scale balances
-       _amount = _amount * inflationMultiplier;
+       _amount = _amount * IECO(_l1Eco).getPastLinearInflation(block.number)
```
