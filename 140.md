# In _initiateERC20Deposit the tokens to deposit are never approved by the function

## Summary
In `_initiateERC20Deposit` the tokens to deposit are never approved by the function, and neither is the `transferFrom` return value checked.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Even though custom `transferFrom` return boolean (true/false) upon success are failure, it is not checked.
2. The transfer `amount` is never approved from the user. The tokens needs to be approved and failure to do so will result in deposit/bridging failure.

## Impact
Deposit/Bridging amount would fail. User might receive the amount on the other side, but protocol would suffer loss of funds.
