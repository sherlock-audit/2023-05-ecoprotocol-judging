# Need to check params

## Summary
all the functions seen within L2ECOBridge and L1ECOBridge do not check the inputs

## Vulnerability Detail
by not checking any inputs, we won't know if the inserted ones are valid, and if they are not, the function will continue without giving any problem instead of reverting, making possible the malfunctioning contract with misinserted variables

## Impact
contract could go with misplaced and incorrect main variables, breaking the logic of the contract itself,in the withdraw function doesnt check that the to address is not address(0)(that would lead to user losing funds wrongly used)

Manual Review

## Recommendation
require that every input should be a possible one,like addresses should be checked as require(add!=address(0)),uint256 inputs should require that are different from 0
