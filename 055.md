# STOPTHECAP - L2ECOBridge initial inflation multiplier should be l2Eco.linearInflationMultiplier() since it might have already changed by a rebase

## Summary

`L2ECOBridge` initial inflation multiplier is set to `INITIAL_INFLATION_MULTIPLIER`, not to current `l2Eco.linearInflationMultiplier()`, which can have a different value in case a rebase had already happened.

## Vulnerability Detail

In a scenario where a rebase operation has occurred before the `L2ECOBridge` is initialized, the `inflationMultiplier` in the L2ECOBridge would be inconsistent with the actual inflation multiplier of L2ECO token. This would lead to incorrect computations in deposits, rebases and withdrawals on the bridge.

During the deployment of the bridge smart contract suite, it is likely that a rebase would not occur. However, since these contracts are upgradeable and expected to evolve with time, using `INITIAL_INFLATION_MULTIPLIER()` instead of `linearInflationMultiplier()` could lead to inconsistencies in the case a rebase had already happened and the contract is upgraded and reinitialized.

## Impact

Incorrect computations of deposits, rebases and withdrawals in the L2ECOBridge in the case the bridge is initialized after a L2ECO had suffered a rebase.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Initialize the `inflationMultiplier` to `l2Eco.linearInflationMultiplier()` instead of `l2Eco.INITIAL_INFLATION_MULTIPLIER()`, so that it reflects the latest state of the L2 token's inflation multiplier.

```solidity
inflationMultiplier = l2Eco.linearInflationMultiplier();
