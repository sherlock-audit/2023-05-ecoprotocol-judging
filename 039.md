# STOPTHECAP - Underpaying Optimism l2gas may lead to loss of users funds

## Summary
The `depositERC20To` and `depositERC20` functions that allow the user to input the `l2gas` will cause the loss of the bridged funds if the `l2Gas` is underpaid

## Vulnerability Detail
The 'L1ECOBridge' contract uses Optimism’s bridge with user-provided l2gas.

Optimism’s standard token bridge makes the cross-chain deposit by sending a cross-chain message to L2Bridge.

If the l2Gas is underpaid, finalizeDeposit will fail and user funds will be lost.

## Impact

User funds will be lost if user underpays l2Gas

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Try to either control that the amount of gas param of L2 is enough `l2Gas`  and not underpaid, or somehow point that issue in all the docs to aware any user before transacting.
