# depositERC20To() is missing onlyEOA() modifier - Leading to loss of user funds

## Summary

The `depositERC20To()` function is missing the `onlyEOA()` modifer which can result in loss of user funds

## Vulnerability Detail

`L1ECOBridge.sol` smart contract has a modifier called `onlyEOA()`. As per the comments in the contract, this is used to stop deposits from contracts (avoid accidentally lost tokens) - So that funds are not sent to an Address which doesn't exist on L2.

This modifier is successfully applied to `depositERC20()` function but is NOT implemented on `depositERC20To` function which essentially does the same task.
The need for `onlyEOA()`  modifier is because EOA addresses exists on all chains - L1, L2. However contract addresses exist on chains where they are deployed to. It is not necessary that same L1 contract would exist at the same address on L2.
Since the `onlyEOA()` modifier is missing on `depositERC20To()`, this means that contracts can also use this function and user will lose their funds.

## Impact

Loss of user funds.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L212-L229

```solidity
    function depositERC20To(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _l2Gas,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external virtual isL1EcoToken(_l1Token) isL2EcoToken(_l2Token) {
        _initiateERC20Deposit(
            _l1Token,
            _l2Token,
            msg.sender,
            _to,
            _amount,
            _l2Gas,
            _data
        );
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L1ECOBridge.sol#L61-L65

```solidity
    modifier onlyEOA() {
        // Used to stop deposits from contracts (avoid accidentally lost tokens)
        require(msg.sender.code.length == 0, "L1ECOBridge: Account not EOA");
        _;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the modifier as the following:


```solidity
    modifier onlyEOA(address _to) {
        // Used to stop deposits from contracts (avoid accidentally lost tokens)
        require(_to.code.length == 0, "L1ECOBridge: Account not EOA");
        _;
    }
```

and wherever `onlyEOA()` is used, update them by supplying a `_to` parameter. For instance, the following functions will be modified to :

#### depositERC20()

```solidity
    function depositERC20(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _l2Gas,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external virtual onlyEOA(msg.sender) isL1EcoToken(_l1Token) isL2EcoToken(_l2Token) {
        _initiateERC20Deposit(
            _l1Token,
            _l2Token,
            msg.sender,
            msg.sender,
            _amount,
            _l2Gas,
            _data
        );
    }
```

#### depositERC20To()

```solidity
    function depositERC20To(
        address _l1Token,
        address _l2Token,
        address _to,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint32 _l2Gas,
        bytes calldata _data
    ) external virtual onlyEOA(_to) isL1EcoToken(_l1Token) isL2EcoToken(_l2Token) {
        _initiateERC20Deposit(
            _l1Token,
            _l2Token,
            msg.sender,
            _to,
            _amount,
            _l2Gas,
            _data
        );
    }
```
