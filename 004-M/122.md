# Malicious actor can delay withdrawals by 7 days if ECO.sol is paused

## Summary

The system is built to return funds to L2 if the call to ECO token reverts. A malicious actor can leverage this to cause temporary DOS

## Vulnerability Detail

If the ECO token is paused
Users that have withdrawn from L2 and waited 7 days after proving their transactions might want to wait a little more time until the ECO token resumes to execute their transaction.

A malicious actor can execute the withdrawal and force the funds to go back to L2.

## Recommendation

Instead of u-turning the funds, just revert and allow users to use optimisms `relayMessage` function to replay the transaction when needed
