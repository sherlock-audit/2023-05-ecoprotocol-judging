# Protocol instructions can lead to loss of funds

## Summary

Withdrawing from L2 requires the user to set the l1gas limit.
According to the code documentation and discord chat the l1gas limit is not used and should not be worried about:
`_l1Gas (on the L2ECOBridge) has been noted by this comment in their docs: @param _l1Gas Unused, but included for potential forward compatibility considerations. We keep the parameter for the same reason as above but it should not be worried about`

While this was true pre-bedrock. Post-bedrock this parameter is important and enforced. 

## Vulnerability Detail

As can be seen in the below comment and in the discord channel the _l1Gas (on the L2ECOBridge) is noted to be unused and not to worry about.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-05-ecoprotocol/blob/main/op-eco/contracts/bridge/L2ECOBridge.sol#L226

Therefore, users can expect that any value there is acceptable. Even values that are above the actual required gas or above the L1 block gas limit.

If the l1gas will be set for example as `type(uint32).max` the tokens on L2 will be burned and a message will be sent to L1.

in L1 OptimismPortal, where transaction are validated and executed there is a check to see if enough gas has been supplied to execute the transaction.

```solidity
        bool _hasMinGas = hasMinGas(_minGas, 0);
        assembly {
            // Assertion: gasleft() >= (_minGas * 64) / 63 + 40_000
            if iszero(_hasMinGas) {
                // Store the "Error(string)" selector in scratch space.
                mstore(0, 0x08c379a0)
```

```solidity
    function hasMinGas(uint256 _minGas, uint256 _reservedGas) internal view returns (bool) {
        bool _hasMinGas;
        assembly {
            // Equation: gas × 63 ≥ minGas × 64 + 63(40_000 + reservedGas)
            _hasMinGas := iszero(
                lt(mul(gas(), 63), add(mul(_minGas, 64), mul(add(40000, _reservedGas), 63)))
            )
        }
        return _hasMinGas;
    }
```

If `type(uint32).max` (or any number close to the block gas limit) is passed as the gas limit the transaction will revert and tokens will be permanently lost.

It is important to emphasize that this is not a USER error. The protocol has actively mentioned that the `l1Gas` will not be used and has not recommended what value it should have.

Loss of funds

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Limit the value of `l1gas` to a number much smaller then the block gas limit (suggesting 1M).
2. Add a warning in the comments and description
