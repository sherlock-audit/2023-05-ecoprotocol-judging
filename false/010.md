# Rebase token does not account properly

## Summary

From the documentation we see:

> #### Q: Are there any REBASING tokens interacting with the smart contracts?
> Yes, both the ECO token and the token in the repo. Rebases are EOA triggered and infrequent.

But the project does not account for rebase tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

Rebasing tokens are tokens that have each holderâ€™s `balanceof()` increase over time.
During a rebase, the total token supply is increased or decreased proportionally across all token holders. The number of tokens held by each address increases or decreases, while the relative ownership percentage remains the same.
Before using `transfer`, `mint` or `burn` functions, you need to check the new balance.

## Impact

Rebase token does not account properly

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To add support for rebasing tokens you need to check the new balance right before a transfer, mint or burn function.
